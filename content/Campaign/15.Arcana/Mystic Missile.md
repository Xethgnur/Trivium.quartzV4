![[Mystic Missile-1692241784905.jpeg|500]]
Arcane energy is crystallized in psionic shards and propelled at a target within range, finding purchase by the same means as the infamous Magic Missile, but with some astounding effects!

You fire three crystalline shards that automatically hit and burst, dealing 1d4+1 force damage each. The shards all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several. A residual cloud of unstable Arcane Energy lingers from the impact. The target or targets must then roll an Intelligence Saving Throw. On a failed save, you must  
roll a 1d6 to determine the effect of the residual cloud for all creatures struck

1. **Charmed** - the creature(s) calms and seems enamored by the caster. 
    - A charmed creature can’t Attack the charmer or target the charmer with harmful Abilities or magical Effects.
    - The charmer has advantage on any ability check to interact socially with the creature.
2. **Despair** - the creature(s) seem to have some sort of realization, and break down
    - A restrained creature’s speed becomes 0, and it can’t benefit from any bonus to its speed.
    - Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature’s Attack rolls have disadvantage.
    - The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity Saving Throws.
3. **Frightened** - the creature(s) look at the caster, and fear reels in their eyes!
    - A frightened creature has disadvantage on Ability Checks and Attack rolls while the source of its fear is within line of sight.
    - The creature can’t willingly move closer to the source of its fear.
4. **Enraged** - the creature(s) is seems to go berserk in a fit of sudden rage
    - The creature uses its immediate reaction to make a single melee attack against the closest creature.
    - The creature then uses its turn to attack the closest creature.
5. **Dazed** - the creature(s) grab at their head, seeming to be unable to stand straight or pay attention
    - The creature is unable to act normally. A dazed creature can take no actions, but has no penalty to AC.
    - Only lasts for the round.
6. **Exhaustion** - the creature(s) seem suddenly, heavily fatigued, sweating and at a loss of breath
    - |   |   |
        |---|---|
        |1|Disadvantage on Ability Checks|
        |2|Speed halved|
        |3|Disadvantage on Attack rolls and Saving Throws|
        

On a successful save, no magical effect affects the creature.  
At the beginning of an affected creatures turn, it must make an intelligence saving throw to dispel the effect lingering effects, except Exhaustion.

When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the spell creates one more dart for each slot level above 1st.
