![[Fidchelle, the Aspect of Lore-1690251152139.jpeg]]

Fidchell appears to be a masked humanoid inset into an ornate lotus flower that balances upon a point. He has four discs in the shape of eyes that hover around him. His mask is also beset with eyes and has four spokes like a fan upon its face, also inladen with eyes. His arms are often kept in a prayer or meditation position. Despite being known as the aspect of knowledge, the proper translation is the Aspect of Lore. He is often regarded for his wisdom gained from the knowledge and memory of history through time.

Fidchell often takes no action, with or against his siblings. He only observes, and that often leaves his siblings in anger with him. However, he is one of the eldest aspects, being the one who observes all of time.

The ancient followers of Fidchell did the same, observe and record. They were known to have vast libraries filled with the knowledge they acquired from others. They were skilled in many things, especially in language and writing. On top of having an extensive background history on the ancient races, they also seemed to follow a prophetic doctrine that was claimed to have been handed down to them by Fidchell himself. However, the true translation of this prophecy seems to have been lost, either buried within the deep knowledge and recordings of his followers, or it had been lost through time.

Though Fidchell has offered no direct assistance, his followers have made artifacts in an attempt to emulate his power and provide ease to their recordings.

Provides the [[Tome of Endless Lore]] to his followers to continue to endlessly gather information and history.
