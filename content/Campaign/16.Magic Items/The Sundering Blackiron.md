 **`=this.file.name` %% description text %% is sentient weapon. A perfectly smooth black metal finish offers only a faint, diffused reflection of iridescent light. The weapon almost hums and wavers slightly, but otherwise seems like an unassuming black metal weapon. None may hold the Blackiron and not feel the weight of its purpose, save for its chosen recipient. In the presence of another legendary weapon, it quivers in anticipation of battle against it. And to win so absolutely against the other weapon as unworthy.**

-Weapon is treated as a +1 magical weapon

- Battlehunger: it does an additional 1d6+1 of the weapon's damage to the first creature it successfully hits on your turn, or during an Attack of Opportunity. 

- Sunderer's Strike: 
	- As part of an Attack Action, you may declare to Sunder the enemy's weapon, picking either an equipped weapon, shield, or attached natural weapon. 
	- The enemy must make a Dexterity Saving Throw DC damage dealt to the target. On a successful save, the weapon is not Sundered. On a failed save, the weapon is utterly destroyed and cannot be used for the rest of the encounter, and the Sundering Blackiron counts as a +3 for the remainder of the encounter. On a Critical Strike, you automatically Sunder the target's weapon, even if you no longer have the ability to do so.
	- You may use this feature once per encounter unless it is a Critical Hit. You must declare that you are Sundering a weapon prior to rolling damage.
- Breaker's Path:
	- As an action, you may momentarily slice through any physical, non-magical object magically, sundering itself from its own material. So long as the object being cut through is smaller than the length of the blade, you can fully separate the halves of the object with a perfect clean cut. You cannot cut flesh or living materials in this manner.
	- You may use this feature equal to your Charisma Modifier.

Proficiency with a greatsword allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with it.
