# `=this.file.name`
## `=this.type` , `=this.rarity`

The `=this.file.name` %% description text %% is a black ring with a black gem that seems to swirl like a dark mist.

**Souldrinker**: The ring cna hold 6 charges. You gain 1 charge whenever you kill(or actively assist in the killing of) a creature. As a Bonus Action, you can activate one of the effects by spending charges.

> - *Dark Presence (1 Charge)*: Surround yourself with an ominous aura that grants you an advantage on Intimidation Checks for 1 hour.
>  - *Black Cloak (2 Charges)*: Cloaks your body in darkness, granting +1 to your AC and you gain an Advantage on all Stealth Checks for the next 10 Minutes.
>  - *Soulstrike (6 Charges)*: Your next 3 weapon attacks (within 10 minutes) deal an additional 3d6 Necrotic damage.
   
> ***CURSED***: If there is at least one chage in the ring and you take a Long Rest, make a Wisdom Saving Throw (DC 14). On a failure, you do not gain the benefits of the rest as your dreams are filled with visions of the souls trapped in the ring.
