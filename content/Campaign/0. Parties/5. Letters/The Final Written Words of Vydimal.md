*found in the [[Tome of Endless Lore]]*

Dear Read([[Evan Escence]]),
Unfortunately, I've had to given up this book. The Winter has called for me, and I cannot abandon The Call, so I cannot fulfill this book. [[Fidchelle, the Aspect of Lore|Fidchelle]] will know this act and that I cannot continue to scribe into this book. And if I do not die with this book, maybe this book can be passed down to another chosen one, and more can scribed into this book. Keep it safe, and maybe you won't have to see this message... and maybe I can see Hysseld again...
