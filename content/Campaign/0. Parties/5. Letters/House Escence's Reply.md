## Letter Contents
%% What was written put here!%%

Dearest [[Evan Escence|Evan]], our son.

We have received your letter for our house, and we are happy to know you are safe. As many of your letters through the arcadian courier service have surmised, we are happy to see that there were less paper used since your last letter, though it still translates as directions and not a personal recount. Your mother had to be explained the letter and humbly asks you handwrite your letters, though I told her of your typical preferal of utilizing pre-established services.

My son, when you get this letter, I implore you; return to Visaros at your earliest leisure. I fear the other houses are growing impatient while the seat of the emperor remains empty. Already, House Ledd has been attacked, and your good friend, Zepplin, has been in the infirmary since the day this letter was sent. I fear it was the work of another House, and so long as they fight, there will be no order within the Empire. The direness of the events here in the capital is so great, even your… teacher… has returned. Please, come home, son...

Please, return safely…
George Diorissimo Escence
