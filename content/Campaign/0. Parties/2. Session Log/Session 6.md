WhichParty: Party 1
Alias: Forlorn Citadels,
QuickNotes: The party has dungeon delved into the citadel that sits at the edge
  of Mire Esmeralda, nearly dying to the undead creatures that block their path.
  The party is still not use to their powers, and strategies are still unsure in
  combat, proving to be detrimental to their advancement through the ancient
  halls. Yet still, the party marches on, seeking Hyseld's hammer as requested.
  However, if the party isn't careful, their first dungeon may just very well
  kill them before the world calls for the heroes they could be...

Following [[Session 5]] :

[[Vimack Badger]] , [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]] , [[Kashoon]] , and [[Evan Escence]] pickup their camp after resting for an extended amount of time to heal and recover, and unbarricade the doors to continue exploring the citadel for the hammer in [[Mira Esmirelda]].

While exploring, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] comes across a tapestry depicting the goddess [[Anngaraad]] blessing the Great General [[Vadathaus Horreneth]], a blessed leader who conquered swathes of human territory in the long ended war between ancient [[Arcaedian|Arcaedians]]  and the [[High Elven|High Elves]].

> [!note]
> [[Kashoon]] have given [[Evan Escence]] his dagger to help him strike with melee attacks.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] continues to explore, and trigger a trap.
> [!fail]
> [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] takes significant damage from a falling stone block.

At the end of the hallway where the trap was triggered, a chest lays in wait. The chest is trapped and releases a puff of gas. Inside is 800 copper, 4000 silver, 1800 gold, and 138 platinum coins, a leather coin purse, a copper clothed tabard, an ornate silver mirror, an ornate ivory drinking horn, lapis urn, platinum amulet, and 3 spell scrolls, and two potions. One is red, and one is brownish.

They explore further and discover a rather well preserved anvil, however, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] are unable to find a way to take it with them. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] crashes through the next door, where the west side of the room contains a kiln and coal hold. In the opposite corner of the room, a large round mass cries.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] tries to sneak around the [[Beholder Zombie]] but [[Kashoon]] trips and creates noise.

> [!fail]
> [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] critically misses the beholder and the fear effect of the [[Beholder Zombie]]  nearly gets to him.

> [!success]
> [[Kashoon]] kills the [[Beholder Zombie]] 

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] scribes the [[Beholder Zombie]] into the [[Tome of Endless Lore]] and comes to find that the beholder is a little out of place for the area. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] investigates a pile of rubble and discovers another black ring.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] then thinks he should burn the [[Beholder Zombie]] corpse they had recently killed.
> [!fail]
> [[Evan Escence|Evan]] poisons himself from the smoke caused by burning the zombie flesh of the [[Beholder Zombie]] 

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] pushes forward but steps on a magical sigil that causes him to be paralyzed. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] pulls him out easily but he remains paralyzed. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] slaps him in the face to slap him to try and break him out of the paralysis, though it does nothing. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] feels everything. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] creates a plan to try and cross the magic sigil, and then [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] is freed from his plight, face hurting. He pulls out rope, and jumps the gap. 

> [!fail]
> [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] tries to jump the gap, but everything that could have gone wrong, went wrong. However, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] is able to overcome the paralysis.

One by one, they jump the corner and avoid the trap's antics any further.

Further up the hall, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] pushes further, and come across a [[Ghast]] and three [[Ghoul|Ghouls]] gnawing at bones and rotted flesh. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] initiates with [[Create Bonfire]] to surprise them.

> [!success]
> [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] eliminates the [[Ghast]] and [[Ghoul|Ghouls]]
> 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] goes up stairs and come across two large iron doors at the top. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] suggests resting before entering the iron doors. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] tries to rest, and the citadel taunts them in their rest, testing their resolve. But each of them manages to ignore the disquiet around them. They rest until 3am, pack up, and enter the room beyond the iron doors.

Inside is a long destroyed by time War Room, where [[Vadathaus Horreneth]] sits at the end of the table, and his generals still sit at the sides. Behind [[Vadathaus Horreneth]] lies a silver and gold warhammer, the one they sought at the behest of [[Hysseld]]. As [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] enters the room [[Vadathaus Horreneth]] begins to stir, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] casts [[Shatter]]. [[Vadathaus Horreneth]] retaliates with a Fear attack.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] tries to have a civil discussion with [[Vadathaus Horreneth]], who is already displeased by his specific presence. However, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] mentions they were sent by [[Hysseld]] to retrieve the hammer, which triggers his anger, displeased that [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] is in league with a dragon, and that the elves will rule again when they obtain the [[Facets of Virtue]].
