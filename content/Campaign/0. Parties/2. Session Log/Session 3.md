QuickNotes: The party takes a short break after the choices that the party had
  made in the previous session as killing the two murderer's has taken its moral
  toll on everyone in the group, each member helping around the town to help
  relieve them of their heavy emotions. Yohan has requested that the party goes
  in his stead to officiate the town by naming and taking the official founding
  papers to Massarnae to add it to the potential trade route. The trip to
  Massarnae is a short one but, much more happens than the party anticipated in
  the town they had left only a few weeks ago...

Following [[Session 2]]:

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] has taken a few weeks to gather their composure and help the town.
[[Vimack Badger]] has been helping with building and major physical labor, taking advantage of his strength, as well as helping [[Asatir]] with Blacksmithing. He's been avoiding [[Yohan Sheppard]] and [[Tyrian Cromwell]] due to some conflicting inner thoughts.

[[Evan Escence]] took to the forest to meditate and recover his knowledge of his powers. He heals [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]'s hearing loss. And proceeds to use his powers to help heal town members.

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]] has the militia with their patrols and training. [[Tyrian Cromwell|Tyrian]] is pleased by this development. While not helping the militia, he contributes to the engineering tasks. He has been avoiding [[Yohan Sheppard]].

The town has since developed quite quickly, with several residential homes already up and living in. [[Yohan Sheppard|Yohan]] has had himself a [[Mayor's House]] built for him and his family. [[Tyrian Cromwell|Tyrian]] now lives in a [[Captain's Lodge]] so that he no longer has to stay with his militia men. And the Cook has started a proper tavern he has dubbed [[The Stewmasters Flaggon]]. 

[[Yohan Sheppard|Yohan]] will finally ask the three party members to see him at his home. He will be greeted and present them with a conundrum, which is naming the town. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] suggests the name [[Dragon's Head]] and everyone agrees it is a good name. [[Yohan Sheppard|Yohan]] needs [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to return to [[Campaign/5. Settlements/Massarnae]] and officiate the town through [[Arcaedian]] law. [[Tyrian Cromwell|Tyrian]] offers some horses to help [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]. [[Asatir]] requests to join, for business of his own. 

A couple of days of travel to [[Massarnae]] and [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] arrives at the gates by morning. The guards give them some guidance. The Party is told to go to [[Hooke's Law District]] to officiate the town through legal means. [[Asatir]] seeks to go to the [[The Masse Market]] to handle his business.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] passes through [[The Kepler Commons]], and notice a foul odor in the air. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] acknowledges the weirdness but continues on their original mission to officiate the town. After officiating [[Dragon's Head]] as a official, legal town under [[Campaign/5. Settlements/Massarnae]] oversight, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] tries to go back to [[The Arcaedian Postal Service]] but stop at the [[The Kepler Commons]] being bothered by the smell. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] wants to investigate, since it smells like dead person. 

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] takes [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to the market district, and seeks a perfume sales man. Upon finding one, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] chimes in and asks for perfumes from [[Noble House of Escence]] but the man has sold out on most of them. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is surprised that the man is legit about his family and history and not just a meme.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] returns to the manhole that leads into the [[Sewers]] where [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] discover two dead corpses. As [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] investigates, they are attacked by [[Ochre Jelly]]s. 

>[!success] Victory!
>[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] slays the [[Ochre Jelly]]s 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] searches the corpses for anything useful. They find various trinkets left behind. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] collects some [[Ooze Goo]] from a glass jar [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] was able to pilfer from the dead bodies.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] exits the sewers. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] asks if there is any place they can clean up after being praised by the locals. They are told of a few places. [[The Pinewood Cup]], [[The Druids Grove]], a place in the noble's district, a place at the slum, [[The Boar's Pint]], and lastly the [[Leatherback Tunn]]. 

The [[Evan Escence|Evan]] decides to seek the [[The Arcaedian Postal Service]] to check on a response to his letter. He receives his reply and they decided to meet back up with [[Asatir]] in the [[The Masse Market]].

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] heads over to the [[Tachyon Divinity]] to try and feel better about his actions in the previous weeks. However, mid confession, bells start to ring and a local screams about undead in the area.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] manages to find itself back together, with [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] hearing all the commotion and spotting [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]]. They spot the undead, and begin to fight them off!

>[!success] Victory!
>[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] defeats some [[Zombie]]s!

>[!warning] Secret
>The [[Zombie]]s were a result of an experiment through the [[High Elven]] locals in preparation for taking over the town come Winter

Local temple keepers provide a couple of rewards to [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] for helping. Some gold, health potions, and a [[Glass Bottle of the Acolyte]]. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] heads to the [[The Masse Market]] to either find [[Asatir]] or take a moment to rest and recuperate at the [[Leatherback Tunn]]. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] notices a particular exotic shop keeper at the center of the market area, [[Rozahhar]]. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] decides to purchase a [[Strange Stone Egg]] from him. A spark comes from [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and awakens something within the egg.

> [!caution] 
> [[Rozahhar]] feels swindled by this development and has taken ill will to [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]. Should be come upon [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] again, he will not be so welcoming to their presence again.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] sells the gem's they've acquired and some magic scrolls they are not able to identify themselves. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] asks a random wizard nearby named [[Joe]] to identify them for cheap. The wizard reads them and reveals they are a [[Scroll of Thorn Whip]] and two [[Scroll of Chill Touch]]. The wizard also notices [[Evan Escence|Evan]]'s ring he received from [[Fidchelle, the Aspect of Lore]]. He identifies it as the [[Ring of Shooting Stars]]. They say goodbye to [[Joe]] and pray they may meet him again.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] manages to find [[Asatir]] again, though he has mixed feelings about having missed everything that [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] went through. The [[Strange Stone Egg]] begins to crack slightly in [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]'s hand, setting [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] into a concern.

A bard Tiefling approaches [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to see if they were the ones that cleared the sewer and dealt with the undead. Pleasantly surprised, he asks if he could join [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] on an adventure to help him write a book. He introduces himself as [[Kashoon]]. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] wants to rest for the night and refresh from their fights and soiling. [[Kashoon]] recommends the [[Leatherback Tunn]], though he lacks any coin.

Within the [[Leatherback Tunn]], [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] are greeted by a host who introduces himself as [[The Pen]]. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] purchases five separate rooms for 40 silver, paid by [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]]. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] gives [[Kashoon]] 5 gold pieces and tells him to get a drink. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] takes [[Kashoon]] to the bar front and speak to [[The Rain]] for drinks. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] then gives him an additional 29 gold pieces, leaving [[Kashoon]] with 39 gold pieces on his person. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] head upstairs to bathe and rest. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] notices that all of his shampoos are of [[Noble House of Escence|House Escence]] products, but takes no further thought into it. And [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] falls asleep into their bathes...

Only to find themselves moved from their rooms into a basement area greeting room, still naked and still in their bathes. A Kenku is at a desk taking notes and repeats what [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] is saying instinctually. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] tries to approach the Kenku, but a Tiefling steps out to stop him. Behind the Tiefling, [[The Beak]] steps out from the shadows to stand by the Kenku. [[The Beak]] demands [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] not interfering in [[The Shadow Snappers]] activities, revealing they are some sort of criminal ring with ties to [[Dragon's Head]]. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] tries to justify they will not interfere if [[The Beak]] does better, though [[The Beak]] simply finds it amusing. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] is allowed to leave, and they come back to [[Kashoon]], and find [[Asatir]] is very drunk. 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] decides to remain in [[Massarnae]] to do some additional research on the tower deed and a few other things. They head to the library per recommendation of the town guard. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] tries to find more information on the [[Strange Stone Egg]] that [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] has, but information seems fairly scarce. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] is interested in the [[Illvidri Herald]]s, but ends up showing him entries on Storm Gods to catch [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]'s interest. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is more interested in the egg however. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] seeks a librarian, and they try to present the egg to the librarian for more info. However, the egg begins to open.

Out comes out a [[Arcane Wyvern|baby wyvern of strange anatomy]]. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] loses his shit and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] activates his motherly instincts. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] is concerned. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] cannot find info in the library for what it eats, so [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] presents it rations; this aggravates the wyvern hatchling and it fires an Arcane Missile from its mouth at [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]]. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] is unphased.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] decides to head back to [[Dragon's Head]] with [[Kashoon]] in tow. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] asks if the wyvern has a name, but [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] has not named it though he has an idea. Nearly there to [[Dragon's Head]], [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] hears a Dragon's Roar emanating from the forest. Two strangers run towards and away from [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]. A [[Hysseld]] crashes through the forest chasing after them, and tells the two in common to not return. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] greets it, and startled, it runs back into the forest. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] chases after it, but the dragon polymorphs into a deer to outrun him. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] loses the deer at a log that crosses the river as a natural bridge, with the deer's tracks implying that it has jumped into the river.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] realizes there is a waterfall at the cliff near the town. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] decides they want to give the deed and then investigate the cliff. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] gives [[Yohan Sheppard]] the town deed. [[Yohan Sheppard]] rewards [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] with 100 gold each for their troubles.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] decides since the day is still new, to investigate the cliff waterfall across the river. They shimmy through a narrow ridge behind the waterfall, where a cavern has been secreted within where something has been residing.
