Following [[Session 1]], 

### [[Black Night and Black News]]
[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]], [[Vimack Badger]], and [[Evan Escence]] return from their victory against the [[Black Dragon Wyrmling]], only to see the town is gathered in the rain for some grave news.

[[Yohan Sheppard]] explains a murder has been committed in the unnamed town. The worker was killed in his tent, along with his wife. The workerâ€™s name was [[Kent Turringfield]], and his wife was [[Lora Turringfield]]. [[Tyrian Cromwell]] mentions his militia has had to stop [[Kent Turringfield|Kent]] quite a few times for his discrimination. 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] investigates the tent and questions the locals. The locals do not provide very useful information. They try the Cook's area; they find out [[Kent Turringfield|Kent]] is fairly racist against anyone who is not [[Arcaedian]]. 

### [[Seeding the Storm]]
[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] lingers behind, and notices that some [[Hvergelmir|Hvergelmir]] have stopped nearby. He speaks to [[Dorizoul]], who seems to be a leader to this group. She sees a storm within [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]'s soul, and asks him to come back later.

Meeting together, they share what knowledge they've gathered. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] returns to the [[Hvergelmir]] that have camped near the town. [[Dorizoul]] meets with [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and helps him awaken it with a [[Ritual of Calm]], revealing an inner storm from within that he can now channel without and become a [[Illvidri Herald]], branded as a Brother of the Storm. 

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] return to camp and then to bed. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] lucid dreams into his mindscape and finds a stranger there. [[Fidchelle, the Aspect of Lore]] has invaded into his mindscape. The being points out [[Evan Escence|Evan]]'s lineage, and then presents him the [[Ring of Shooting Stars]], whose purpose is also not yet known. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] assumes its some sort of trinket gift.

### Time to Awaken
[[Evan Escence|Evan]] awakens, he checks on his party and begins to talk to his imagine friend. A soldier spots [[My Immortal]] and screams, waking [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] calms down and agrees to get breakfast. However, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]]'s greatsword is missing. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] notices the [[Hvergelmir|Hvergelmir]] have left camp before the morning while they are walking to the Cook's area. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] wishes to hang out with the [[Hill Dwarves]] while eating breakfast in hopes to obtain some info. There they are greeted by [[Thurdrum of Aspintimber]], woodwork chief of the hill dwarves in town. They mention they do not smith, but there is a half-orc in town who does it instead. And to remind him to return the hammer he borrowed. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] inquires about the engineering nature of the watermill, but Thurdrum tells him to seek out the gnome engineers in town, [[Xotor]] and [[Paudri]]. 

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] decides to go see about the half-orc blacksmith, [[Asatir]]. He asks about his greatsword and [[Kent Turringfield|Kent]]. He says he's gotten in a few fights with [[Kent Turringfield|Kent]] and has not seen his greatsword. 

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] go to see the elven related folk who joined the town. They explain that they are hunters and gatherers for the town for now. They ask if they've had problems with [[Kent Turringfield|Kent]], though they've only been verbally abused and nothing more.

They seek out [[Ferdinand]], [[Kent Turringfield|Kent]]'s foreman. He describes [[Kent Turringfield|Kent]] as hotheaded and gets into fights but he was a hard worker none-the-less. He mentions that his axe broke and had to go to the half-orc blacksmith. He got into a tussle with [[Asatir]] but came back alive and bruised.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] all goes to see [[Asatir]] and continue to question him about [[Kent Turringfield|Kent]]. Since he's the only blacksmith in town, he mentions that most projects go to him, and [[Kent Turringfield|Kent]] does not like anything orc related. He mentions that his hammer was stolen, which is why he had to borrow one from the Dwarves, though its not fit for his work. It was stolen a couple nights ago, and he chucked one of his unfinished knives at the thief and missed, but all he saw was a mottled skinny fellow but no details. 

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] attempts to use [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] as a distraction while [[Evan Escence|Evan]] investigates that knife. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] sneaks up to the door, and opens it. He spots an orc woman inside. He tries to retreat but the orc woman has spotted him. She charges him. [[Asatir]] calms her and regathers [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]. [[Asatir]] explains that she is [[Miroz]], his wife. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] begins to think that someone was setting [[Asatir]] up to appear to be the murderer.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] investigates the Gnomes in town. They unfortunately know nothing about a missing greatsword or hammer. 

### Missing Men
While resounding on their information, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] realizes they need to return the [[Rod of Elements]] to [[Old Man Haggard]]. They discover his wagon has disappeared, but not been moved. It either teleported or floated away. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] attempts to see if something invisible remains, but there's nothing there. Even the locals say the space was empty. They return to [[Tyrian Cromwell]] and [[Yohan Sheppard]] to try and ask about the militia and [[Old Man Haggard]]. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] investigates [[Tyrian Cromwell]]'s bunk but nothing seems out of the ordinary. 

While re-investigating the tend of [[Kent Turringfield|Kent]] and [[Lora Turringfield|Lora]], [[My Immortal]] manifests by itself, startling [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]. Out of reaction, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] summons his greatsword, [[The Sundering Blackiron]] to his hands. 

### The Killers Return
They settle down and, at the advisal of [[My Immortal]], they go seeking the half elves again. They discover a tent has a shallow hole into it, with a bloodied dagger and hammer inside. During this moment of revelation, the suspects return to their tent. Upon their entrance, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] summons the [[The Sundering Blackiron]], [[Evan Escence|Evan]] summons [[My Immortal]], and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] steps out from his hiding spot. A wild tussle in attempt to capture the suspects ensues.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] manages to capture the two, and they reveal their names are [[Falkoris]] and [[Sylkilia]], brothers and in service to [[The Shadow Snappers]] and [[The Beak]] to keep an eye on the town. As a threat, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] weighs their lives to get more information. He executes one on the spot, causing the other to be in fear and confess as much as he knows. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]], feeling remorseful of his brother's actions, suggest exiling the remaining brother, but chooses to shoot him in the back and leave him to nature as a form of mercy. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] overall feels very grimly over the events, and decide they need time to process things while helping the town develop into something settle worthy.
