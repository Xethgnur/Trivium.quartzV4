QuickNotes: Knowing what they must do, Ronpip, Evan, and Vimack set off into the
  unknowns of the southern forest with the flight assistance of Hyseld, the
  Golden Dragon. But since the Wood Elves have hidden themselves from the world
  for so long, getting to them to speak with the Summerset Princess will be a
  challenge unlike any other. A forest protected by ancient Fae Magick has lots
  of tricks down in its roots. All the party has to do is stick to the path...

Following [[Session 7]] :

[[Hysseld]] drops off [[Evan Escence]], [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]], [[Vimack Badger]], and [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] just north of the forest where he encourages [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to speak with the [[Summerset Princess]]. He drops them off at a set of hidden gates, made of branches and plant life. [[Hysseld]] warns [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to remain on the path, no matter what they hear or see. 
[[Vimack Badger]] takes the lead, and takes [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] deep into the forest as far as he could tell. The stone slab path weaves between the trees. [[Evan Escence]] detects they Fey are nearby through his [[Cursed Ring of Seething]], and takes caution. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] begins to hear the sound of something struggling off the edge of the path. Being a being of goodness within his large heart, [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] feels compelled to help what ever creature this is. A couple feet off the path, [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] comes across a [[Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]] stuck. Meanwhile, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] hold on a rope tied to [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] to make sure he can return the path with no issues, or pull him if he is danger. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] carefully frees the [[Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]]. The [[Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]] thanks him and introduces himself as [[Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler|Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]], to which he then asks [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] "May I have your name?". [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] shakes the [[Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]]'s hand, and gives the [[Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]] his name, which causes a puff of pink smoke to blast between them, as now their names are forever(?) exchanged.

[[Evan Escence]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]] proceed to question [[Vimack Badger|Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]] about what just happened. This only angers [[Vimack Badger|Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]]. In an attempt to chase after the [[Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]] that stole his name, [[Vimack Badger|Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]] gets his in the back of his head from a log trap and is dropped into a bright blue portal. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] do their best to contain the rope, but the force of the rope drops [[Evan Escence|Evan]] to his side as he is dragged into the forest. He tries to grow claws through [[My Immortal]], but the earth is soft the roots don't hold. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] tries to anchor himself down with his weapon, but his grip on the rope and his weapon do not save him. The three of them are left freefalling through the portal, and are thrown out on the otherside, dropping into [[The Feywild]], a plane of dreams, whimsy, and the fey. Before [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] could consider recovering, the portal closes behind them and forms a gnarled wooden hole within a tree.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] goes through several strange events that test their patience, wits, and willingness to deal with whimsical obstructions. This includes a path that loops no matter the direction taken, a satyr who ***really*** wants to share his drink, a lake that plays an enticing tune to draw strangers into it, a litter of blink dog pups and their mom, sticky mud trap set up by some tricksters, a brook with a tree man named [[Kenobade]] sitting on a boulder while sheparding other tree kin who provides them directions to someone who can help them leave the Feywild, a big rock with a tiny village next to it, little bramble people riding bramble lizards, and a massive lake containing many crabs spawned from a building sized crab.

Finally passed all these obstacles, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] follows a river upstream and comes upon a mushroom house with a watermill. [[Bonley Shroomcap|A gnome]] greets them. He's confused as to why people of the Material Plane are doing in the Feywild. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] explains they were tricked by a [[Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]] into falling into a portal, and [[Vimack Badger|TIddlefiddle McBottomfondler]] says his name was taken. Understanding, [[Bonley Shroomcap|the gnome friend]] prepares a portal back into the Material Plane.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] finds themselves back in the Summer Forest, but near the city of wood gnomes called [[Cumberbatch]]. [[Bonley Shroomcap|The gnome friend]] guides [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] through the city, and has to hand [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] a special silk mask for them to breath freely from the magical enchantment that would normally put strangers to sleep. He introduces himself as [[Bonley Shroomcap]]. He leads them to the [[Elder's Tree]] where [[Elder Torgey Snailback]] agrees to help [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]], specifically [[Vimack Badger|Tiddlefiddle McBottomfondler]]. [[Elder Torgey Snailback|The Elder]] prepares a ritual, and returns [[Vimack Badger]]'s name to him. Relieved, they ask to be guided to the Wood Elven capital to speak with the [[Summerset Princess]]. [[Elder Torgey Snailback]] volunteers [[Bonley Shroomcap]] to take them there for skipping out on his duty days. 

He leads [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to Wood Elven city of [[Bryturdel]]. The townsfolk do not pay them much mind, and are oddly helpful to them. They direct them to the palace at the edge of town where they can speak to the [[Summerset Princess]] about their mission. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] is continued to be surprised at how unguarded the entrance, the town is, and the palace gates. Even the guards are oddly nice to them. When asked if they can see the [[Summerset Princess]], one of the guards has to go check something. He momentarily comes back with [[General Orthorion]] who questions them. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] reveals that they have come about the High Elves potentially invading. He is skeptical, but allows them passage into the palace. As they walk, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] talks and reveals more details to [[General Orthorion]]. He takes them into a Conservatory that acts as the throne room, where the [[Summerset Princess]] sits within. She leaves her space and approaches [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] with an aura of authority and power. She asks what [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] desires with her presence. They are as honest with her as they were with [[General Orthorion]]. The [[Summerset Princess]] waves the guards of the room off, and her personality switches, revealing her true fey nature. She asks if [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] has any proof, but [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] has none. Orthorion insists that he and [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] can check on [[The Tree-ty]] on an island just outside the summer forest. The [[Summerset Princess]] accepts, and allows [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to rest and to meet with Orthorion in the morning.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] meets with Orthorion and a small squadron of elven guard. They take to the water with specially made canoes that wade through the river and into the ocean, and on to [[The Tree-ty]] Island. Orthorion and his guards lead [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] upon an old path, where at the center of this small island and an intertwined tree of two different species. At first, it appears as though both are standing, but upon closer inspection, one of the two trees has begun to fade and die within. Orthorion, in disbelief, tests it with touch and is tense.

Without warning, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] and the guards are ambushed. The two elven guard brought along were immediately shot through the necks, and [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] draws their weapons and prepares themselves for combat!
