Following [[Session 10]] :

[[Evan Escence]] takes on the [[Tullum Pugna Nula]] requested by [[Brand Diodah Urie]], taking him and his companions, [[Vimack Badger]], [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]], [[Lorellai]], and [[Paul McCoy]] to the amphitheater that acts as their arena to face off against [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]] and his own allies. [[Tylos Laetios Mositia|Tylos]] initiates the combat to begin, and the two parties attack.

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] immediately summons the [[Tool of War]] and casts [[Shatter]] upon the closest member of [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand's]] group. A [[red dragonborn]] rips his cloak off and charges towards [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]], but [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] is too quick with his Greatsword. With intensity, he attacks [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] again, and manages to get a strike in, though [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] parries the attack to lessen its blow. Next, [[a cloaked Half-Elf]] dashes in and strikes at [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]], summoning green flames across his blade. 
> [!danger] DOWNED
> [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] is incapacitated from the strike!

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] spawns an area of thorns and spikes upon the ground before [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand's]] group, making it difficult for them to move. A [[human with a mace and shield]] climbs through the [[Spike Growth]] and waves a hand, sending a wave of necrotic energy at [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]. [[Paul McCoy|Paul]] stays where he is and prepares. Brand and [[King of the Clouds]] send a wave of psychic energy across [[Evan Escence|Evan]]'s party, causing [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] to nearly hit [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] and also causes him to feel frightened of [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]] and his menacing presence. The [[Tiefling Wizard]] casts a red hot beam of energy at Paul. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] casts [[Mystic Missile]] at several targets, infusing his arcane missiles with his psionic influence. The [[human with a mace and shield|Cleric]] is hit and is Charmed, seeing [[Evan Escence|Evan]] as an ally. The [[red dragonborn|Figher]] is hit and is Dazed. The [[a cloaked Half-Elf|Rogue]] manages to overcome the effects but is still damaged by the spell. [[Lorellai]] begins a [[Prayer of Healing]] and heals her allies from the initial hits. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] is revived, and tosses his [[Tool of War|blade]] at the [[a cloaked Half-Elf|rogue]] who promptly dodges it. He then moves out of the way, with a plan in mind. The [[red dragonborn|Red Dragonborn]] has to shake his head and recover from the Dazed blow. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] compels himself, brings himself to a rage, and fires from his longbow at [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]], missing one shot but hitting with his second shot. He then whistles and [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] charges arcane energy into her mouth and releases it, hitting [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]], the Cleric, and the [[red dragonborn|Red Dragonborn]] with a flurry of arcane missiles. The Cleric attempts to move forward to attack the [[Arcane Wyvern]], but ends up stabbing himself and is too weak to get through the floor of bramble and thorns. Paul gets confirmation from [[Evan Escence|Evan]] to proceed, and then proceeds to attack the [[red dragonborn]] with a surprising amount of speed, only hitting once but hitting with enough force to Stun him. [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]] points at [[Paul McCoy|Paul]] and puts him in a state of shock with the illusion of [[Evan Escence|Evan]] dying. The Tiefling Wizard makes a sign of the shadows, and summons a [[Hound of Ill Omen]] from his own shadow to target [[Evan Escence|Evan]], which then sprints through the brambles and thorns to get to him. He attempts to then summon the weave to cast [[Fireball]] but [[Evan Escence|Evan]] uses [[Counterspell]] to rip the arcane energy away from [[Tiefling Wizard|the Wizard]]. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] takes up [[The Talisman of Pure Good]] and attempts to send [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]] straight to hell, but [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]] absconds from it and is unaffected. [[Lorellai]] rushes in, and attacks the [[red dragonborn]], smiting with her flail in hand twice, and then shield bashes into him into the brambles and thorns, knocking him out of combat. The [[Hound of Ill Omen]] charges [[Evan Escence|Evan]], and locks its jaw into his arm, pulling him to the ground Prone. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] Pulls out his shield while tossing a dagger, using it to Conjure Barrage, striking Brand and his lackeys with spectral daggers. He then hops on to [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] and summons his [[Tool of War|sword]] to his hands, willing it into a lance as it reforms. The rogue dives through the brambles and attacks [[Lorellai]] quickly to then disengage into a better position for himself. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] drops his bow and pulls out his second sword to attack the [[Hound of Ill Omen]] that is attacking [[Evan Escence|Evan]]. 
> [!success] CRITICAL HIT!
> [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] manages to strike the [[Hound of Ill Omen]] with a reckless critical strike and strikes it with lightning!

Paul runs to [[Evan Escence|Evan]]'s aid, and hits the [[a cloaked Half-Elf|rogue]] with a flurry of unarmed strikes, hitting the Swashbuckler three times and knocking them out of the fight!  Brand creates a whirlwind around him, and flies over the brambles. He channels psionic energies, and blasts an intense gust of wind to knock [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] and [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] away, but it does nothing to the wyvern or gnome. The [[Tiefling Wizard]] bites his thumb and creates a demonic circle upon the ground in blood. It opens up, and [[Hezrou|a fiendish hand]] reaches up from the abyss and climbs out. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] recognizes that its not an arcane spell. [[Lorellai]] recognizes it as a Summon Lesser Demon spell. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] sees in the crowd a particular noble performing subtle arcane gestures. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] from the ground casts [[Mystic Missile]]. The [[Hound of Ill Omen]] is struck and receives a sudden wave of Exhaustion. The [[Hezrou|demon]] and the wizard are hit, with the wizard falling to the ground from the hit. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] then has [[Flumph|Caesar]] move towards [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]] but the stench of [[Hezrou|the fiend]] causes it to feel suddenly sick. Still, it reaches over to [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]] and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] channels [[Shocking Grasp]] through it. He tries to get up to his feet, but the [[Hound of Ill Omen]] keeps [[Evan Escence|Evan]] to the ground. [[Lorellai]] rushes at [[Hezrou]], passing through the waft of the [[Hezrou|demon's]] stench. She strikes at it with her flail, though her strikes seem to do little damage, her holy smites seem to hit for a lot. She then bashes it with her shield. The [[Hound of Ill Omen]] mauls [[Evan Escence|Evan]] while he remains locked to the ground. The [[Hezrou|summoned fiend]] attacks wide, swiping for [[Lorellai]], [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]], and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]], though [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] and [[Lorellai]] manage to get out of the way. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] draws upon the magic of the [[Tool of War]] and gives himself temporary vigor while also stilling his warrior soul for real vigor. Then, with intensity in a surge of energy, he attacks [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]] with his lance and channels [[Booming Blade]] through it but Brand dramatically dodges out of the way of the attacks. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] dives in at the [[Hound of Ill Omen]] recklessly.
> [!success] CRITICAL STRIKES!
> Both swords come in and cross section into the [[Hound of Ill Omen]], lifting it off the ground and forcing it to dissipate in shadowy smoke.

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] then moves to the edge of the arena, and tries to call out the noble who was making the arcane gestures he was noticing. But the noble does not expose themselves, and [[Tylos Laetios Mositia|Tylos]] is getting concerned of [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]'s actions. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] tries to explain his actions to Tylos, but Tylos is not convinced and is prepping to be defensive, turning [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] back to the battle and implying consequences to the alternative. Paul helps [[Evan Escence|Evan]] stand up from being mauled by the [[Hound of Ill Omen]]. Brand is mad that the [[Flumph]] shocked him, and flicks Caesar with psychic energy, obliterating it.
> [!fail] 
> Caesar was killed in battle.

Brand then uses his Psionic Energy to cloak himself in a spinning funnel of air. [[Lorellai]] tries to maneuver away from the fiend, but it sees an opportunity to bite into her. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] draws upon psionic energies and casts a beam of Radiant energies at the summoned demon, blinding it and forcing it to let her go. [[Lorellai]] dives in to hit Brand, misses and he manipulates the flail to hit her back, but it misses her. She shifts her weight and hits the summoned demon instead, smiting it across the side. The summoned demon, enraged by the blinding effect, tries to maneuver towards [[Evan Escence|Evan]], or where it felt it was being shot at. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] and [[Lorellai]] take advantage of its lapse in judgement and strike! [[Lorellai]] manages to get a strike and smite in.
> [!success] CRITICAL STRIKE!
> [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] manages to strike in with his lance into a vital area.

The summoned fiend lashes out to the general area of [[Evan Escence|Evan]], but misses with its wild strikes. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] goes after Brand again with [[Booming Blade]] channeling upon the lance. Brand has to swiftly dodge as [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] is starting to read his movements, and the second jab catches him, striking into his shoulder and enveloping him with sonic energy. Tylos and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] tell [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] to get back into the fight. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is still angry about the noble interfering and climbs off the stage. Tylos draws his sword and takes an attack against [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]], but [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] swipes it away with a short sword and proceeds towards the noble. He tries to reason angrily with the noble to dispel the summoning, but the noble ignores him to the best of their ability. He returns to the stage upset, and gets close to the summoned fiend, striking it with the collected static charge within his body. Brand lashes into [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]]'s mind with a psionic whip. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] moves away from the summoned demon, and it tries to take a swipe at the movement. [[My Immortal]] comes in and shields [[Evan Escence|Evan]] from the bite. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] draws upon his psionic energy and tries to shove Brand. He stands his ground and is unmoved but is still pummeled by the force of the blow. [[Lorellai]] moves away from Brand, and Brand takes a swipe at her with his axe, gashing into her armor and his gauntlets channel psychic energy into her, knocking her out of the fight. The summoned fiend goes for [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] as he is the biggest and closest target. In its wild strikes, its claws rake across [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] but he gets out of the way of its bite. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] continues to pierce at Brand, adjusting into a Precision Strike, hitting him and once again dousing him in sonic energy.
> [!success] [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] Kills [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]]
> [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] strikes him directly into the eye, channeling his sonic energy into his head, and causes his head to explode.

Before he died, Brand stumble about and states He his future was to become the Emperor, "[[Madame Darlayia]] predicted it! She promised me a crowd, the wine would run through the streets" as his entire head explodes.

The demon finds itself unsummoned, trying to claw its self back to the material plane but gets sucked away.

Tylos then declares that [[Evan Escence|Evan]] of the [[Noble House of Escence]] has won the battle. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] is sickened by the cheers and the aftermath. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is in a battle rush, cheering with [[Evan Escence|Evan]] by picking him up, before they realize that [[Lorellai]] is bleeding out on the ground. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] rides [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] to [[Lorellai]], and with a [[Healer's Kit]] stabilizes her. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] angrily picks her up. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] plays up the victory with some effects, before realizing that his friends are extremely upset and wish to leave. Tylos congratulates [[Evan Escence|Evan]] for his victory, and reveals that the [[Noble House of Escence]] now takes all from the [[Noble House of Urie]], merging in favor to the [[Noble House of Escence]]. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] is stunned and pleased, though [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] reminds him that its less people now to help the country. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] asks about a healer for [[Lorellai]] and Tylos gives healing through his hand into [[Lorellai]]. She awakens with a startle but [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]], although angry, keeps her calm. 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] looks into the remains of [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand's]] companions. [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand's]] has some unique Bracers that intrigue [[Evan Escence|Evan]]. The [[Tiefling Wizard]] has a [[Wand of Fireballs]]. The [[red dragonborn]] is wearing [[Smoldering Plate Armor]] and dons [[Gauntlets of Flaming Fury|Burning Gauntlets]]. The Rogue is wearing [[Boots of Speed|Speedy Boots]]. The Cleric has a [[Necklace of Prayer Beads]]. 

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] wishes to go see what he has inherited. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] stares at the dead bodies and contemplates his lance. Paul accompanies [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and [[Lorellai]] back to the Escence Estate. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] joins them after having a momentary discussion with the [[Tool of War]]. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] gives [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] the spoils to [[Identify]] later. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is still upset about the summoned demon and huffs off when it seems [[Evan Escence|Evan]] does not know what happened. 

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] heads to the Financial District to discuss the acquired assets. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] explains the situation to an associated, who takes him to a private room while they collect the paperwork pertaining to the [[Noble House of Urie]]. 

Meanwhile, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] discuss what he saw; [[Lorellai]] is kicking in his arms. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] states he saw one of the nobles in the audience summoned the demon and continues to be angry. Until he starts to hear some soft singing in Giant on the wind. He calms himself so that he can gather a better direction of the song. He breaks off from the group and goes towards the song. Paul takes [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] and [[Lorellai]] back to the manor.

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] continues to wander through town to find the source of the song alongside with [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]].

A halfling enters the private with [[Evan Escence|Evan]]. A cart of papers follow him in. [[Jackson Copperfield|The halfling]] has a distinct level of concern in his voice but [[Evan Escence|Evan]] takes no immediate notice. The halfling tells [[Evan Escence|Evan]] that the [[Noble House of Urie]] has a substantial bank of gold under their name, but also substantial debt that is now under the responsibility of the [[Noble House of Escence]]. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] signs off on the exchange and heads back home. 

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] has been tracking the song that is currently taunting him. He reaches the north eastern part of town, coming upon a bridge where [[Dorizoul]] is standing there, oddly alone without her followers and unarmed. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] calls out to her, and though she does not give apparent heed, she hears him. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] sees that she is staring into the water below. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] inquires what she is doing here, and she explains that this was part of [[The Pilgrimage of Giants]] that the Old Ones took. She informs him that the district is called [[Pilgrim's End]], and the bridge [[Lover's Crossing]], related to the tale of two Frost Giant Lovers from opposing mountains who could not be together. She is cryptic during the entire exchange but [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is catching on. She makes an odd request for [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] to deliver a stone ring to a hole stone hiding within the canal below the bridge. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] takes the ring and dives into the water. The current is strong and is beginning to pull [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] away from the bridge. Though the water obscures his vision, he sees a standing stone with a hole, and swims towards it. He drops off the ring within the hole. It disintegrates from his hand, the hole stone and glows with Goliath runes, striking his hand with light, and deep dark blue tattoos come from his hand and finger. Suddenly, he feels where North is at all time and has a sensation of the lover's embrace. He returns to the bridge, coughing water out but returns nonetheless. [[Dorizoul]] is no longer at the bridge, which saddens [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]. Though he notices a piece of wood with giant's runes carved into it reading, "Hope to see you again..." With nothing more needed, he heads back to the manor.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] regathers at the manor and tries to redetermine what they want to do. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] would like to [[Identify]] the magic items they acquired while [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] rests at the Ecsence manor. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] starts with the gauntlets, and find they are the [[Evan Escence|Evan]] starts With the gauntlets, and find they are the [[Gauntlets of Heavenly Ascension]]. He finds the wand of fireballs is in fact the [[Wand of Fireballs]]. [[Boots of Speed]]. The Steel Gauntlets are the [[Gauntlets of Flaming Fury]].  

Following the next day, a messenger from the [[Noble House of Foo]] arrives at the Escence manor, requesting him and [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to visit the estate of the [[Noble House of Foo]] at their earliest behest. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] has been stewing about the noble who interfered with the battle, and finally connects the dots between the noble and the colors of the house they were associated with. Together, they plan for the next day...
