Following [[Session 11]] : 

> [!note]
> This Session was a large mix of low rolls, and misinformation and  from the DM. Especially at the end.

[[Evan Escence]], [[Vimack Badger]], and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]] are eating breakfast at the Escence manor. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] lets [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] know that they have been invited to the [[Noble House of Foo]]. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] chimes in and asks about the house's colors, which [[Evan Escence|Evan]] relays is not the same as the one is he troubled by. [[Lorellai]] has a stomach ache so that she can be removed from the session for the time. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and crew reach the [[Noble House of Foo]]'s estate and find that the estate is different from the other noble estates, have a very apparent Eastern style. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] sees a funny opportunity to fondly the brass gate knockers, but ends up lifting them out of their holders. He ends up throwing them behind him, and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] tries to catch it on the way, but its weight causes it to slip through his fingers and crash into the ground. A servant greets them at the gate, accepts the apology for the knocker, and takes [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to [[Duan Ping]], the Patron of the house. Along the way, [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is concerned that [[Evan Escence|Evan]] cannot hold a sword properly. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] mentions he only ever held one for play, which confuses [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]]. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] takes out a sword, and hands it over to [[Evan Escence|Evan]], who promptly takes it. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] are appalled, and they have to get him to adjust. 

The servant opens the sliding door, and [[Duan Ping]] is sitting at a table with tea. He welcomes to join him at the table. He speaks in Wuzhia to a servant to have them close the door and make sure the area is clear from listeners. [[Duan Ping|Duan]] lets [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] know that some elders of his house have been exchanging treasonous information between the Arcaedian government and [[Wuzhia]]. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] asks why its a problem, and [[Duan Ping|Duan]] puts in the weight of the situation. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] then asks how he found out this information, and he mentions his mother, [[Yin Lei]], was berating another elder of the house, [[Xun Fen]]. He also believes a different elder, [[Qui Chun]], has been doing odd dealings with Wuzhia sailors. Lastly, he had his servants recover documents revealing payments to royal healers, but not for any healing. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] speaks aloud about how they are beginning to believe the former emperor of [[Arcaedia]] was assassinated. [[Duan Ping|Duan]] wants [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to try and investigate with as little commotion as possible, feeling that his house is not worthy to take the throne and that his own house is against him. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] shares that the High Elves are also intending to invade, and exchange their tale of the summerset kingdom. [[Duan Ping|Duan]] believes [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]], and promises that if [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] can help him, he will help them. He suspects all three suspects believe [[Duan Ping|Duan]] knows and refuse to be present when he is around. He congrats [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] on their victory against the [[Noble House of Urie]]. He pulls [[Evan Escence|Evan]] aside for a moment and tells him to keep away from [[Gau Meng]]. 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] first heads to the [[Pillars of Archons]], where the noble meeting was held. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] try to use GET HELP to try and maybe reach the royal healers directly, but a [[Judge of Arcaedia]] comes in and [[Lay on Hands]] to heal [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]], thwarting the initial plan. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] instead wanders the halls of the [[Pillars of Archons]], and upon finding the healer's area, continue to deliberate on what to do. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] knocks on the healer's door, but find no one answers and the door is locked. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] casts Dimension Door to get passed the door. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] hears that [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is putting the crowbar into the door, and stops him. He slowly investigates the area but finds he is ill equipped for the situation. He pops back to [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] and explains the door is locked on both sides. They go back to the crowbar plan, but [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] fails to open the door and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] catches the sounds of [[Judge of Arcaedia|Judges]] walking by. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] tries again after they pass by, but the door does not give. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] split and talk to separate Judges, asking about the healers and why the area was closed. They explain that the healers were sent home since there was no emperor. 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] heads over to the Eastern dock, where Wuzhian trading ships are more likely to dock. The group finds themselves at the [[Leifell Harbour]], where they find a few ship of Wuzhian in origin which all fly the same bronze dragon across their sails and flags. The come to find a [[Zhi|Copper Dragonborn]] seems to be the admiral to those group of ships at dock. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] goes to speak to him and he introduces himself as [[Zhi]]. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] has a typical conversation with a mercantile sir, but then insinuates that he might have a secret stock of something, which bothers [[Zhi]] and he immediately threatens him. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] tries to save face but fails; [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] points out a odded out person of Wuzhia origin working with sailors to stock a warehouse. After the sailors finish and they close the warehouse doors, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] moves in to investigate. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] goes wings and takes [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] up to the second floor barn doors. He climbs in and spies upon the men inside, who have become weary of the sudden noises from the roof and doors. Things don't go the way that [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] needs, and have to flee.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] returns to the manor in order to come up with a new plan on how to fulfill their quest. They take a long rest for [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]]'s sake, and plan to return to the Royal Healer's area while at night. They casually walk into the [[Pillars of Archons]] and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] casts [[Knock]] upon the door to unlock it. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] then investigates the area. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] discovers that the [[Noble House of Paramoure]] has been requesting more physicians than usual at the [[Cathedral of Stars]]. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] discovers the [[Noble House of Chevelle]] have been requesting large amounts of heavy narcotics and pain killing medicines and the [[Noble House of Van Halen]] has been monthly obtaining exotic medicines. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] finds a medical journal that includes an entry mentioning *"the former emperor was poisoned by something foreign to [[Arcaedia]]"*. They have what they think they need and set out on their next objective.

They return to the docks to check out the warehouse again. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] manages to get in the same way as before, and finds the warehouse has been emptied. They investigate the inside, and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] discovers an illusory floor covering a trap door leading to a basement underneath the warehouse. The illusory floor fizzles out when they open the trap door, and within, there is a pitch dark room with thin shelves with boxes labelled with the mark of [[The Shadow Snappers]]. Inside the crates, they find glass vials of some sort of strong toxin, that [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] accidentally samples. They scour the rest of the boxes and find numerous amounts of contraband. While discussing how to handle the discovery, they hear footsteps enter the warehouse. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] creates the smell of a skunk to try and get them to go away, but the scent makes them worry the wares have gone bad. The footsteps come closer faster, and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] creates magical darkness to hide them. The two investigators enter, and find they can't see anything. They retreat, and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] attempts to close the crates they had opened and return them, being the only one able to see within his own magical darkness. When the person returns down the stairs, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] tries to create a delusion within the enterer's mind, creating the sound of of the barn door above from closing. He begins to rustle for something in a bag, and he pulls out a lit hooded lantern that seems to pierce through the magical darkness.

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] aims his sword at the light source, and fires two beams of Eldritch Blast through his sword. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] lobs [[Mystic Missile|Mystic Missiles]] at the two perpetrators, causing one to suddenly feel a wave of despair, and the other to feel enraged and smack his friend. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] rages and tosses the shelves nearest to him. The three of them manage to exit the room and drop the trapdoor. They hear lots of screaming from within, and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] dispels the magical darkness, and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] sees the two victimized by the drugs and toxins in the worst overdose he could witness. While trying to escape, [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] wonders what happened to them, and with [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]]'s desire to leave quickly, [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] does not want to leave them behind. He makes it back to the trapdoor, and cannot see or hear anything going down there. Before he can rush down there, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] summons a psionic wall to stop him, and warns him this is the consequences of working for [[The Beak]]. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is stopped, but is clearly very upset at the results of their actions. And with nothing more to do with the warehouse, they return to [[Evan Escence|Evan]]'s manor.

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] desires a bath and asks [[Paul McCoy|Paul]] if he may set one up. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] wishes to join and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] decides it would be good to join as well. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] abuses his ability to breathe underwater to stew over his actions. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] become concerned and attempt various things to get him to return to the surface. They eventually coerce him to return to the surface and confront them about this ability.

And with that the session ends...
