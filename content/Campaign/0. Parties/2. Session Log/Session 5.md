QuickNotes: Hysseld the Gold Dragon has sent the party on a fetch quest for his
  hammer, which was left in a ancient elven town that has performed a ritual
  spell that prevents him from ever entering the town's domain. He knows the
  party's power is incredible from their experience with the Time Mirror, but is
  it really incredible enough for them to overcome the challenges ahead? Can the
  party overcome a haunted marsh, filled with hate filled, high elven ghosts?
  Will Kashoon survive this delve, even though he is not a typical adventurer
  himself...?
Alias: Haunted Marshes,

Following [[Session 4]] :

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]] , [[Evan Escence]] , [[Vimack Badger]] , and [[Kashoon]] pack up their camp from just outside [[Mira Esmirelda]] and enter the town. They start by heading towards the plaza passed the rotted buildings that are slowly being consumed by the swamp. Seeing nothing left about to find, they head to the temple area. At the center, they find a statue of [[Anngaraad]] made of moonstone, untouched by the swamps corruptions. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] regards how much the statue might be worth, and its apparent that it would be worth a lot of coin. This makes him wonder why the people would just leave such an expensive statue.

With nothing else catching their interest, they move to the citadel. [[Vimack Badger]] tears open the gates to allow [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to enter into the area. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] enters the citadel, and it is dark, dank, and stale air. Exploring through, they first encounter a [[Wraith]] and [[Specter|Specters]] of long dead elven soldiers who demand them to leave.

> [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] shoots [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] in the ass with a Volcanic Arrow, setting it on fire 

> [!success]
> [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] successfully defeats the incorporeal enemies.

After the encounter, [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] continues to explore, and stumbles into a room with a [[Banshee]] crying inside. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] panics and tries to shut the door, but [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] opens it, taking a swipe. She wails and shakes the walls, knocking [[Kashoon]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] out. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] manage to bring [[Kashoon]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] back to consciousness, and [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] defeats the [[Banshee]].

> [!success]
> [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] successfully defeats the [[Banshee]] 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] takes a Short Rest, and then continue to search for the Hammer. They come upon a tapping noise, and investigate, only to be spotted by and attacked by a [[Revenant]], that specifically targets [[Evan Escence|Evan]].

> [!fail]
> The [[Revenant]] critically strikes [[Evan Escence|Evan]], and damages him to the point of near death.

> [!success]
> [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] successfully slays the [[Revenant]]

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] discovers a black ring in the ashes of the [[Revenant]] and pockets it.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] then decides they need to take a long rest before continuing to explore, braving the potential dangers by setting up camp within the citadel.
