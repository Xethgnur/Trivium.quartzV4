WhichParty: Party 1
QuickNotes: The Party has found the Hammer! It, in fact, was at the highest
  point in the citadel. But, they have awoken the high elven general, Vadathas,
  who died long ago and has been sustained by his hatred for humanity and the
  dragon. He interrogates the party, and Evan mistakenly admits they are here to
  seek the hammer for Hyseld, to which the High Elven General becomes enraged,
  raises his minions, and the session begins with the party entering combat.
  With a foe unlike any other, will the party survive this encounter!?

Following [[Session 3]] :

[[Vimack Badger]], [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]], [[Evan Escence]], and [[Kashoon]] enter the cavern hidden within the waterfall on the cliffside near the town of [[Dragon's Head]]. At the end of the cavern, there is a room with a particular function to create tension, but is otherwise harmless, as well as an open well with bismuth liquid swirling within.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] dips his mace into the well. The mace now has a flaming property. He also dips his bolts in, and they receive an explosive property.

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] tries to dip his sentient sword in but the sword advises against it. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] instead dips his short sword in, giving it the lightning property. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] dips a set of arrows in and they also receive an explosive property.

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] dips his short swords in, and they have poison and ice properties, respectively. He also dips 19 arrows into the vat, giving them the petrifying property.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] enter the next room. There is a giant sign that says "Greeting Room" in large letters. There is a large statue at the centre of the room made of brass depicting a hero by the name of [[Havvrod]], the Knight of Gold. A wind up box that [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] begins to wind explains that this is some sort of Exhibition Room dedicated to this hero, and a new door opens. As [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] explores, everything looks forlorn and left to waste. They come upon a security room with magic mirrors depicting other rooms within the facility. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] comes upon a Lost and Found area, and discover a set of paired bracelets [[Lost & Found]] and a [[Ion Stone of Intellect]].

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] makes their way to a hall of statues, where the armours come to life! Combat Ensues against the [[Animated Armor]]s.

After combating the armours, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] pushes forward, and enter an abandoned amphitheatre, a strangely clean relic room, and gallery of ancient paintings and statues. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] renews his [[Detect Magic]] and realises that [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] has a magic object in his pocket. He notices its fairly powerful in its enchantment. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] fumbles with it, and discovers it is an [[Ion Stone of Intellect]]. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] goes back the amphitheatre and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] notices a false wall, and discover a spiral stairwell going downwards that get bigger as they go down. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] wishes to run down the stairs in excitement and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] wishes to get out of the mist by climbing up [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] end up walking normally down the stairs instead.

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] comes upon the dragon's chamber, enormous rooms dedicated to things larger than himself. The rest of [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] catches up and find [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] gawking at the environment. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] decides to sneak through the area, along with his other companions. They proceed towards the observatory that appears to be under the river near [[Dragon's Head]]. At its center, a rectangular table with hologram of the town and its residents.

Caught observing the holograms, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] suddenly finds itself blown by a powerful wind and shunted into a new space unlike the dwellings of the dragon. Except for [[Evan Escence|Evan]], who remained, unaffected by the wind and unafraid of a golden dragon baring down on him. 

[[Evan Escence]] converses with the gold dragon, revealing he and his companions went through the Exhibition Rooms, to which the Golden Dragon immediately apologises for [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] having to venture through it. He brings [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] back, introduces himself with many names, his true name as [[Hysseld]] but tells [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] they've called him [[Dr. Hammond]] before, and asks for the rod. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] tries to share his wyvern to [[Hysseld]], but [[Hysseld]] seems most disturbed by the presence of the creature. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] asks [[Hysseld]] to help protect the town in their stead, for a favor. He asks [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to retrieve his hammer from an ancient and long forgotten [[High Elven]] town where he was magically banished from. He hands a magical lute to [[Kashoon]], which will help return [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to him. He also provides [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] one magical item from his storage.

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] chooses the [[Animated Shield]]
[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] chooses a [[Ring of Protection]]
[[Evan Escence|Evan]] chooses a [[The Talisman of Pure Good]]

[[Hysseld]] also provides a special book to [[Evan Escence]], one that contains an extensive amount of knowledge accumulated by scribes of [[Fidchelle, the Aspect of Lore]]. Inside, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] finds a loose piece of paper inserted into the book with a single name written on it, "[[Vydimal Thorrestor]]". Upon writing the name into the [[Tome of Endless Lore]], he discovers [[The Final Written Words of Vydimal]]. [[Hysseld]] states he was an old friend long lost.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] wants more information on the town they plan to go to, and writes out [[Mira Esmirelda]] into the [[Tome of Endless Lore]], which provides a pop-up version of the city directly from the pages of the book. [[Hysseld]] points out that his hammer would most likely be in the citadel, towards the north most end of the city.

With as much information as [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] desires, [[Hysseld]] pops [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] as close to the city as his magic could take them, which is a Elven gateway into the area claimed for the city. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] passes through the gates, and can feel the residual protection spell still locked in place. However, with the sun already getting low, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] decides to camp out just outside the city's gates before sun down so they can explore the forlorn town in the daylight.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] asks [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] to reveal the symbol on his chest to potentially show information on it. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] wants to know more about the [[Arcane Wyvern]], however, the drawing does not reveal information but asks for an entry. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] tries to write about the [[Tool of War]] but the book also produces a page asking for an entry. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] asks about [[The Beak]] and the [[Leatherback Tunn]] and although it does not return any information on [[The Beak]] specifically, it provides a generic description of tavern. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] then asks about [[The Shadow Snappers]], but it also comes out with some generic information, but reveals that the criminal gang has a ring spanning across [[Arcaedia]]. 

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] asks [[Kashoon]] his opinion of [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]], which [[Kashoon]] answers awkwardly but honestly. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] casts [[Zone of Truth]] and interrogates [[Kashoon]] about [[The Beak]] but he denies any knowledge about any criminals, and says he just wanted the freedom of Barddom to escape his former occupation. 

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] finally reads his [[House Escence's Reply]] that he had on him for a few days, revealing that the Noble Houses have been vying for power, and his return is requested to be expedited as being the first born son puts him in line for the throne and threatens the reputation of [[Noble House of Escence|House Escence]].

While taking watch, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]] takes first watch, and his anxiety keeps him on edge but nothing significant happens. [[Evan Escence]] takes second watch, and spots glowing humanoid silhouettes glowering at him and [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]. [[Vimack Badger]] takes final watch, and those glowering figures are back, with more than what [[Evan Escence|Evan]] described. He stares them down through the night...

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] picks up their camp, and enters the Emerald Mire.
