 Following [[Session 9]] :

The session begins with [[Evan Escence]] facing off to the challenge by his master [[Ed Sher'ran]]. Meanwhile, [[Vimack Badger]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]] stand by to watch this play out. The two duke it out between their psionic manifestations and powers, displaying strange and erratic abilities that ultimately destroy the garden area. This attracts [[Jacqueline Escence|Evan's Mother's Attention]] and she too summons a psionic manifestation she calls [[Lacuna Coil]], that causes [[Ed Sher'ran]] to cower in fear and dismiss his manifestation. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]], too, is caught by surprise and can feel the menacing presence of [[Jacqueline Escence]] and her [[Lacuna Coil]]. [[Jacqueline Escence|Evan's Mother]] demands to know why they are destroying her yard, and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] tries to explain the situation while [[Ed Sher'ran|Ed]] hides behind him in fear. 

This is the first time [[Evan Escence|Evan]] has seen his mother perform this. Ed reveals that [[Jacqueline Escence|Jacqueline]] had these powers on her own and was hired to train [[Evan Escence|Evan]], revealing [[Evan Escence|Evan]]'s lineage being that of a Kalashtar. He asks if his father is also Kalashtar, but she reveals he is nothing more than Human. She also explains that [[Evan Escence|Evan]] is the only one who has it and that his siblings do not, and that the rest of [[Arcaedia]] does not know about this, and would prefer to keep it this way. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] promises to clean up the place, while [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] are showed to their guest rooms.

Meanwhile, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] seeks reassurance from Ed, asking him if he should continue down the path of chosen by a god of scribes. But Ed declares that he should forge his own path, instead of taking one built for him.

He then has a dream overnight, once again taken by the [[Scribes of Fidchelle]], and this time a group of them take him to a court room to judge him over what his actions may be. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] surrenders the book and taunts them to make sure they take note of every detail. He awakens, seeing he can't summon the book. Instead, he decides to make his OWN book of arcane arts with the combination of his psionic powers.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] has two days before they can meet with the other noble houses, and thus go about their own personal business.

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] immediately heads over to [[The Arcaedian Postal Service]] in the Capital City, and writes two letters to [[Thimbleville]]. He then heads to the nearest market district. He notices some elves trying to cater to the commonfolk, handing off pendants that include a tooth. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] acquires one at request, and then seeks out a blacksmith, specifically the blacksmith who sold him his original great sword. He finds the dwarf blacksmith, and requests a shield. They exchange wears, and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] inquires about his new, magical sword. However, its clear the blacksmith is surprised to see the sword spawn from nowhere. When trying to handle the weapon, it seems like the blade weighs tens of times more than it appears. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] is now doubly surprised. The interaction confuses the both of them, and they part with no further exchanges of wears or coin. He returns to the Escence Household and purchase a ham along the way.

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] decides he needs more nature in his life, and is recommended to visit one of the local parks to feel a bit more nature in the urban environment. There, he meets a peculiar [[Water Genasi]] who introduces herself as [[Lorellai]] who had dreams, which included [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]], and possibly his companions. She requests him to gather his companions and join her on her quest, but [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] needs to discuss it with his friends.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] runs down the stairs to share what he has completed over night. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] shares concerns over [[High Elven]] activity in town and questions [[Lorellai]]'s presence, though its very apparent she is an embodiment of innocence. They continue to question her, her intentions, and what she can do; enough so that [[Paul McCoy]] managed to cook the ham all the way through and serve it to [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]. After a quick meal, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] decides he needs to demonstrate what he can do. He turns [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] small, which he takes advantage of to ride [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]]. He tries to have [[Lorellai]] to hit him to summon a shield, only she shatters his shield with the blow. He then has [[Paul McCoy]] gather him materials, and he begins the ritual to Find Familiar, in which [[Evan Escence|Evan]] spawns a [[Flumph]] that he names [[Flumph|Caesar Speedwagon]]. And continues to demonstrate through the day what he can do.

The following day, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] heads out with [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] to visit [[Ledd]]. Together, they find [[Ledd]] completely pummelled from head to toe. Bruised and beaten and barely breathing, [[Ledd]] provides only a few words to [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] before passing out: "Don't trust the moon"
Once they leave the house, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] shares with [[Evan Escence|Evan]] the carved tooth that high elven speakers were exchanging to commoners in the market area. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] casts [[Detect Magic]] and finds that its magical, showing a necromantic aura. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] heads to the library seeking spells, but is finding that books are expensive. So instead he seeks scrolls! Remembering a magic shop, he heads out to a nearby market area, where he walks into the shop and spots a copper dragonborn named [[Rasul]]. He requests a [[Scroll of Identify]] and an offensive spell scroll if available. [[Rasul]] finds a scroll in his inventory and gives [[Evan Escence|Evan]] a discount for his family's reputation, but cannot offer an offensive scroll at discount. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] pulls the amulet of the carved tooth out and asks if [[Rasul]] cast [[Identify]]. He reveals that is called the [[Thrall's Neckpiece]], and allows the wearer to deal magical necrotic damage and heal from it. It also seems to invoke a bloodthirst within the wearer. With nothing further needed, the two head back to the mansion. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] rushes to his room to inscribe the spell into his book. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] meanwhile stops by George's office to pull a book from their personal literature collection.

The following day, [[Paul McCoy]] announces that [[Evan Escence]] is invited to the [[Pillars of Archons]] where the noble houses will be meeting. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] questions if all of them should go, but [[Evan Escence|Evan]] reminds him that [[Ledd]] was terribly beaten, and as far as the nobles are concerned, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] is a weakling not worth even a low blow. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] attempts to brief the group on etiquette while attending the meeting. 

While traveling into the [[Pillars of Archons]] [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] passes below the heroes of [[Vasaros]] from its history. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] reminds [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to keep an ear out on the other noble houses while the meeting is going on. Within, there is an open air hallway where royal guards stand at ready and nobles pass or gather. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and party is lead to a large open-air, decagonal chamber where a balcony is prepared for the [[Noble House of Escence]], bearing its colours and insignia to identify him among the other houses. Each noble house has its own balcony decorated with their own colours as well, with [[Evan Escence|Evan]] scanning to find the noblemen from the guards. An [[Judge of Arcaedia]] steps forward to a high seat within the chamber, that [[Evan Escence|Evan]] recognizes as [[Tylos Laetios Mositia]]. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] puts on enough of a intimidating presence that it puts off most of the guards, except for one from the [[Noble House of Urie]] who is as big as [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]. [[Tylos Laetios Mositia|Tylos]] sits upon his mediators chair and introduces himself per tradition, with the chamber in silent anticipation. As soon as he finishes, the chamber breaks out in cacophony of chaos, with Tylos doing nothing to mediate given how often this has happened.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] listens to the best of his ability to try and make some sort of decision. [[Lorellai]] offers her divine sense to find good and evil among the crowd. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] asks for her assistance. [[Lorellai]] detects partial fiends from Tieflings in the crowds, persons from the [[Noble House of Urie]], [[Noble House of Van Halen]] and [[Noble House of Paramoure]] give off an aura of evil while the [[Noble House of Foo]] and [[Noble House of Chevelle]] show an aura of goodness about them. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] takes note, [[Noble House of Foo]] has been silent the whole time, and takes a stand upon the ledge of his balcony and belts with with psionically amplified voice his case for himself to be chosen as emperor. He calls out the shamefulness of the houses for bickering for so long, and pushes his case further. The patriarch of the [[Noble House of Foo]] then stands and calls [[Evan Escence|Evan]] out for his hypocrisy and grand standing when he left the city state for five years. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] uses this as an attempted comeback, but the crowd is not swayed. [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]] from the [[Noble House of Urie]] proclaims that his house has more than enough money to cover everything, and thus it should be him, countering that a worldly view truly sees a probable demise on its way. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] stumbles a bit and confides with his friends, but [[Lorellai]] steps forward and pours her personal story and beliefs to the crowd, turning their hearts and heads towards [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and the [[Noble House of Escence]]. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] notices that [[Noble House of Foo]] acknowledges the story subtly, and [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]] is scowling at the spotlight being taken away from him.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] takes the chance to push further that uniting is the key to a successful rule, and that they all need to unite in order to overcome what will befall them. And that there should be proof to the people to gather the power of the people. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] tries to guide the chambers into civility but Tylos lets him know that they've tried it, with a bit of vinegar in his voice. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] then takes this moment to step forward again, and reveal that the High Elves are seeking to invade the Dominion, enslave humanity, and to continue to fight among themselves their job is only becoming easier for them. Tylos seems well persuaded by [[Evan Escence|Evan]]'s words, but a hooded priest in the [[Noble House of Paramoure]] has suddenly gone rigid and defensive. 

[[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]], out of nowhere, calls out to Tylos a [[Tullum Pugna Nula]] which is an ancient law which allowed the nobles to fight each other to the death for the masses. He does not believe his case, and dares to prove that [[Evan Escence|Evan]] is nothing more than the smallest house while setting himself up for more power.

As per the tradition, the defendant is allowed to declare the terms of combat, while the prosecution chooses the location. Brand chooses the public amphitheater at the bottom of the hill beneath the [[Pillars of Archons]], which will make it available for the most public eyes. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] sets the terms to companions versus companions, no holds barred, and declares he is ready to see who will knock the other out first. Brand laughs and states it is to the death. Tylos slams his gavel, and declares the terms of combat determined, and the last of the house to stand is the house that stands. 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] goes shopping for last minute requirements before proceeding to the amphitheater that will act as their arena. To [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]]'s surprise, Paul is with them, but he assures [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] that he is there to protect [[Evan Escence|Evan]], just as he was instructed to since [[Evan Escence|Evan]] was born. With four companions with [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and four companions with Brand, the two groups strut out to present themselves. The public are doing their best to get as much of a view as possible with the noble houses seated in lifted structures to allow them to see the action. Tylos will come to the edge of the amphitheater and relay the terms of combat to them, letting the feeling of death weigh in on [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and Brand. He calls upon [[Evan Escence|Evan]], and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] struts with [[Style]] and gets some wow from the crowd. [[Brand Diodah Urie|Brand]] is called forward, and he imitates [[Evan Escence|Evan]]'s strut. Tylos calls for the two to shake, which [[Evan Escence|Evan]] extends a hand and Brand swats it away. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] mutters his revenge while Brand foretells his end. The two return to their groups. Tylos unsheathes his sword, raises it to the air...

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] then reminds [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] about the dog he loved that was killed, and reveals that it was Brand who did it. This immediately triggers [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]], who is now out for blood.

...and with a shimmering swing of his sword, cuts down with a beam of light to begin combat. Brand strikes a pose, and announces that he knows [[Evan Escence|Evan]]'s secrets, and reveals his own Psionic Battle Spirit, [[King of the Clouds]]. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] summons [[My Immortal]]. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] summons his sword. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] rages. [[Lorellai]] readies her flail and shield.

And trial by combat commences...
