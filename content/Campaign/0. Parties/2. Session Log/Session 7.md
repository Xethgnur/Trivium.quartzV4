Following [[Session 6]] :

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]], [[Evan Escence]], and [[Vimack Badger]] (accompanied by [[Kashoon]]) find themselves in combat with an undead general who has brought back to life the armours of his long dead generals.

[[Vadathaus Horreneth]] leashes [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] with lightning and blows an ominous gust of wind that closes the door behind [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]], trapping them with their undead assailants.

>[!caution]
>One of the [[Helmed Horror|Helmed Horrors]] critically wounds [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] with a Necrotic Longsword. 

Meanwhile, [[Helmed Horror|Helmed Horrors]] block the rest of [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] from assisting [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]. Luckily, his [[Animated Shield]] protects his back.

> [!caution]
> [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]] is critically damaged by one of the [[Helmed Horror|Helmed Horrors]]

> [!fail]
> [[Evan Escence]] critically fails his [[Guiding Bolt]], causing it to fizzle out.

After three rounds of combat, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] is beginning to feel the weight of the battle against them. 

> [!success]
> The [[Helmed Horror|Helmed Horrors]] have critically missed some of their attacks.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] creates a psionic wall between him and the Horrors and plans to make maneuvers.

[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] drops a short sword and in a rage, rips the Hammer out of its stone hold, enveloping him with light and freeing him from [[Vadathaus Horreneth|Vadathaus']] spell.

He tries to convince [[Kashoon]] to use the Lute of Returning, but it does nothing as they are still in within the barrier that prevents [[Hysseld]] from entering the area.

> [!caution]
> [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is critically injured by a [[Helmed Horror]] again!

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] manages to chuck his sword directly into Vadathaus, and teleports for the first time back to his sword, and manages to his him with two attacks.

While wielding the [[Hammer of Hero's Gold]], [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] notices the [[Helmed Horror|Helmed Horrors]] have lost their vigor.

> [!success]
> [[Vadathaus Horreneth]] critically missed [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] and he takes advantage of it with an Attack of Opportunity 

[[Vadathaus Horreneth]] fends off [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] with his might, downing [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]]. [[Kashoon]] heals [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and stabilizes him from death. 

> [!success]
> [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] takes advantage of a Critical Miss, striking down a [[Helmed Horror]] with an upwards swing, and cleave through the armor with a blunt weapon. Motes of light spawn upon the [[Hammer of Hero's Gold]] and he directs them to [[Evan Escence|Evan]], bringing him back to consciousness.

Conscious, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] is being carried away by [[Helmed Horror|Helmed Horrors]]. He summons the might of [[My Immortal]] and bolsters his strength and flies straight into the air, taking the [[Helmed Horror|Helmed Horrors]] with him and crashing them into the ceiling and back to the ground. 

> [!succeed]
> [[Kashoon]] gives [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] a potion. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] reawakens and attacks [[Vadathaus Horreneth]], Critically Hitting him AND killing him.

[[Vadathaus Horreneth]] dies once again and forever more. The [[Helmed Horror|Helmed Horrors]] that remain fall to the floor, still once more. Dawn peeks through the ceiling, and the cold morning air makes the victory feel sweetest.

The [[Arcane Wyvern| Arcane Wyvern, Dorizoul]] suddenly evolves and grows to a medium size, surprising everyone.

They look through [[Vadathaus Horreneth]]'s items. They find a [[Bag of Bounty]], [[Adamantine Armor]], [[Moon Blessed Double Scimitar]], [[Cloak of Elvenkind]], and [[Dagger of Warning]]. 

They try to have [[Kashoon]] play the Lute of Returning again, but it seems the spell stopping [[Hysseld]] is still active.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] makes their way outside the gates of [[Mira Esmirelda]] and [[Kashoon]] plays the Lute of Returning. Just before he finishes the song, a [[Judge of Arcaedia]] tries to stop [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]. But with the song ending, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] is teleported into [[Hysseld]]'s chamber.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] returns the [[Hammer of Hero's Gold]] and make sure the town is safe according to [[Hysseld]]'s table of the town. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] recounts their time in [[Mira Esmirelda]], and [[Hysseld]] lore drops about the Elves and the Anti-Human war. He also warns to [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] that if the High Elves are invading, they would move when the first snow falls, and suggests going to the Capital to warn the leaders of the impending invasions.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] returns to [[Dragon's Head]], finding the town has not changed much in the passed three days, putting their hearts and minds at rest.

[[Vimack Badger]] takes [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to [[Yohan Sheppard]] to let him know that [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] has more travels to go to, but that he would like to live here. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]] and [[Evan Escence]] feel the same way, more or less. [[Yohan Sheppard|Yohan]]
tells [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] that he needs an upfront pay but to think about how much they are willing to offer.

[[Kashoon]] timidly wishes to leave [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]], but Vimick beats him to it and offers him a Tulled Leather Coinpurse with a sum of money for his troubles in joining. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] also gives back his dagger.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] returns to [[Yohan Sheppard]] and provides him with 100 platinum's worth of upfront pay to start the hold for [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]].

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] next go to [[Asatir]] and try to recover a new short sword for Vimick and possibly work the [[Adamantine Armor]] [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] acquired, but [[Asatir]] says its beyond him unfortunately, and the amount of work to make a short sword would take longer than [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] might like.

After a quick dinner, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] takes to the air by growing wings. While aloft, he notices an [[Vydimal Thorrestor|armor clad person]] on [[Havvrod|horseback]] sprinting towards the town from the North, the direction that they were before teleporting in.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] glides back down and gathers [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to confront [[Vydimal Thorrestor|the Judge]]. [[Vydimal Thorrestor|The Judge]] questions them about their purpose North of Town, and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] manages to make a convincing excuse for [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]'s presence in that area. [[Vydimal Thorrestor|The Judge]] warns them not to go back there, and then leaves.

They race to the dwarven area, and discuss house plots and the [[Adamantine Armor]]. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]] dons the armor, and is rather surprised at how well it fits when properly fitted. [[Vimack Badger]] inquires about the origin of such a metal, and [[Thurdrum of Aspintimber]] mentions to seek out the Dwarves in the Southern Mountains.

When [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] takes its slumber, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] has a vivid dream in a space within a Parthenon of Metal and Weaponry. He speaks to his weapon given humanoid form, who warns that War is coming. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] asks "War with who?" but receives no response before he suddenly awakens.

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] heads to [[Hysseld]] and he discusses where to take [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] in order to make preparations in a defence against [[High Elven]] invasion. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] agrees to seek the [[Summerset Princess]] in Southern [[Arcaedia]], hidden away in a thick and wild forest area. Vimich also asks [[Hysseld]] if he has a short sword he could use. [[Hysseld]] offers him the [[Katzbalger of the Promising Hero]]. 

While prepping for the adventure, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] acquires additional items such as arrows, potions, and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] attempts to identify the two black rings he has in his possession. The first one he tries on the [[Cursed Ring of Seething]] which sticks to his finger and refuses to come off. He then tries on the [[Black Seal]], which is also Cursed. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] puts on a magic item that is a [[Black Skull with a Shield]]. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] also looks to their Spell Scrolls, but know not what they can do.

After two days have passed, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] returns to [[Hysseld]] and he takes them on a speedy flight across the country.
