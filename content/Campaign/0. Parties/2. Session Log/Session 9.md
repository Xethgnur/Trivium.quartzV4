Following [[Session 8]]

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]] , [[Evan Escence]] , and [[Vimack Badger]] , along side [[General Orthorion]], find themselves ambushed on [[The Tree-ty]] Island by unknown assailants, who have dropped two of their escorts. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] sprouts wings, creates a wall of force to try and separate leaders from lackeys; and moves forward to get an advantage, which draws fire to him.

> [!danger] Critical Damage!
> [[Evan Escence|Evan]] is Critically Wounded by one of the Assassins with an arrow and drops the psionic wall

[[Druid of the Circle of Winter|A Druid]] summons a large bol of moths that bite into [[Evan Escence|Evan]] while he is in the air, obscuring [[Evan Escence|Evan]]'s vision and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] from [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] try to concentrate on one [[Elven Assassin|assassin]], but he's dodging everything they are throwing at him.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] flies straight up to escape the cloud of moths, and uses his [[Ring of Shooting Stars]] to fire a ball of lightning at a [[Priestess Yurreina Paramoure|priestess]] and [[The High Elven King|a cloaked figure]], but they side step the spell. Two [[Elven Assassin|assassins]] attack [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]], one drawing two arrows that his [[Animated Shield]] blocks, but the one in Melee manages to draw his long sword and gets two swipes in. Another shoots at [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]]. Another fires two at [[Evan Escence]] but misses. The Priests fires a sickly beam of green energy at [[Evan Escence]]. 

There appears to be an additional enemy that is not making any move or taking any action. He seems to only be observing [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]. 

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] uses his [[Tool of War]] to aim his fireball at a central location, singing several attackers. [[General Orthorion]] manipulates his arrows to curve around cover.

> [!success] Critical Strike!
> [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] recklessly attacks and manages to finally score a hit on the [[Elven Assassin|assassin]] who has been dodging him, and it is a critical hit!

With inspiration of the critical hit, he also manages to get his second sword into the [[Elven Assassin|assassin]]. He whistles for [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] to move into position, and she comes in running for a Trample, and knocks him prone. Since [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is raging, lightning arcs from his body into the target but he manages to just narrowly dodge a direct hit.

[[Evan Escence]] channels psionic energy to direct [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] to a location psychically, and then he flies into cover to cure his wounds from the heavy attacks he sustained.

The [[Elven Assassin|assassins]] draw their arrows, two hitting [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] and two hitting [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and one hitting [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]]. [[Druid of the Circle of Winter|The Druid]] tosses an ice knife at her prone ally, which does not hit but still explodes into ice shards. 

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] turns his [[Tool of War]] into a sword and goes into melee, missing his first strike but hitting his second. [[General Orthorion|Othorion]] continues to pelt his intended target. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] strikes with two attacks and kills the [[Elven Assassin|assassin]] by taking his short swords straight through his chest. [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] charges to her [[Elven Assassin|shooter]] and Tramples him over. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] whistles and she kicks him while he is prone, but his armor protects him from her stomps. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] moves over in preparation, and lightning arcs from his body to the now prone attacker. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] channels his psionic powers and creates an area of darkness, covering the area of [[Druid of the Circle of Winter|the druid]], [[Priestess Yurreina Paramoure|the priestess]], and [[The High Elven King|the being who has only been watching]] the entire combat. He then calls upon [[My Immortal]] to attack the [[Elven Assassin|assassin]] with [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]], but she misses as he parries her.

[[Elven Assassin|The assassin]] with [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] manages to catch one hit in with his frosted longsword against [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]]. One tries to make hail mary shots towards Evans but miss terribly. The prone [[Elven Assassin|assassin]] attacks from prone, with one strike hitting [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] at the legs with his own frosted longsword. [[Priestess Yurreina Paramoure|The priestess]] in darkness attempts to dispel the darkness but finds she could not.

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] channels a Second Wind and attacks his target while casting [[Booming Blade]] across his sword. Sonic energy surrounds the [[Elven Assassin|assassin]]. 
> [!success] Critical Strike!
> [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] makes a second strike critically striking, and goes from the right side of his neck and through his armor to his arm, bisecting him.

[[General Orthorion|Othorion]] continues to curve his arrows around cover. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] continues his rage and strikes out against the prone [[Elven Assassin|assassin]], but only one short sword hits. [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] follows up with kicks, which [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] follows up with another short sword attack, and then bears down his lightning strike. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] commands [[My Immortal]] to strike and she fills the [[Elven Assassin|assassin]] with holes with blinding speed of her rapier. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] then compels [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] to attack twice again, in which one of the strikes find purchase. 

The [[Elven Assassin|assassin]] that was prone will flip back to his feet. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] manages to get a hit on him, but the [[Elven Assassin|assassin]] retaliates with a strike of his own, dropping [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]. [[Druid of the Circle of Winter|The druid]] transforms within the sphere darkness.

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] tosses his sword in [[General Orthorion|Othorion]]'s direction, and then teleports to it, telling him "We need to get outta here!" but [[General Orthorion|Othorion]] does not seem to take heed. He instead fires two arrows into the darkness and knows he hit, before moving to cover. [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] does her best defend [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]], and she blasts him with her arcane breathe attack. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] calls upon [[Healing Word]] to revive [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]]. 

Meanwhile, nothing has happened within the sphere of darkness. No one has entered or left.

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] rallies [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] and gives him an extra moment of vigor. [[General Orthorion|Othorion]] continues to fire upon something in the sphere of darkness with his bow and arrows, using magical enchantments that [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] does not understand. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] can hear the sounds of a canine getting wounded but see nothing. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] stands and consumes [[Potion of Healing|a potion]] to help heal his wounds from battle. Everyone repositions themselves until [[Evan Escence|Evan]] can drop the sphere of darkness. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] compels [[General Orthorion|Othorion]] to make additional attacks, and then dispels the darkness. Inside, a [[Winter Wolf|white blue wolf]] stands at the ready to attack. 

[[Winter Wolf|The wolf]] moves forward and then howls an icey gale at [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]], [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]], and [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]]. [[Arcane Wyvern|Dorizoul]] manages to protect her vitals, but [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] take the full icey bite of the attack.

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] backs up and conjures a barrage of spectral daggers at [[Winter Wolf|the wolf]] with one of the daggers he obtained from [[Asatir]]. [[General Orthorion|Othorion]] drops his bow and goes into melee with [[Winter Wolf|the wolf]], striking twice causing icey blood to freeze upon the ground nearby. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] knocks and arrow and fires a brambled arrow to the corner of the island, causing a bramble patch to bloom rapidly, reaching [[Winter Wolf|the wolf]]. He then concentrates on [[Winter Wolf|the wolf]] and marks it with [[Hunter's Mark]].  [[Evan Escence|Evan]] speaks words of healing with [[Mass Healing Word]] to provide more health to [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]], and allows [[General Orthorion|Othorion]] to make additional attacks. 

[[Winter Wolf|The wolf]] lunges at [[General Orthorion|Othorion]], gnashes him in her jaws as she shakes him with gore shakes, dropping him prone and bleeding. [[Priestess Yurreina Paramoure|The priestess]] creates a portal near her and the cloaked figure, one of inky blackness that seems to tear a hole into the space.

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] gathers eldritch energy in his blade, and fires it at [[Winter Wolf|the wolf]], the damage causing [[Winter Wolf|the wolf]] to revert back into [[Druid of the Circle of Winter|her humanoid form]]. She is looking like she is on her last legs. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] then takes cover. [[General Orthorion|Othorion]] crawls away while she is momentarily distracted. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] aims with his longbow, and fires one of the petrifying arrow, hitting her in the back. Slowly it turns her to stone, and she is petrified into a statue.

[[The High Elven King|The cloaked figure]] and [[Priestess Yurreina Paramoure|priestess]] step through the portal. And hostilities end.

[[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] wants to get [[General Orthorion|Othorion]] back to the [[Summerset Princess]], but [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] try to pillage the remains. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]], now interested, cuts the head off of one of the dead assassins and takes a mask. They acquire some additional arrows for their quivers. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] gives [[General Orthorion|Othorion]] a Healing Potion in order to help with the gash in his side. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] tries to pick up a longbow, but it crumbles in his hand like weak ice. They pick up the wood elven guard and pack the bodies into the canoes. They drag the remaining bodies of the high elf assassins to the cliffside and drop them into the ocean for the fish to consume. They rip the staff out of the petrified [[Druid of the Circle of Winter|druid's]] hand, breaking it in half(and thus causing it to lose its magic), before dumping her statued body into the ocean as well. 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] returns to the canoes to join [[General Orthorion|Othorion]], and they paddle back to [[Bryturdel]]. [[General Orthorion|Othorion]] calls for guards to care for the bodies, and then takes [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] back to the [[Summerset Princess]] to discuss the events and what to do further. [[General Orthorion|Othorion]] vouches for [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]]'s words and stands by them for their cause. 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] recalls that there is no emperor on the seat of [[Arcaedia]], and the nobles are still fighting over it. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] says he can convince his family to help, but he cannot vouch for the other noble houses, and one of his friends from the [[Noble House of Zepplin]], [[Ledd]] has been hospitalized during this vie for power. He says he has good relations with the [[Noble House of Mumford]] and the [[Noble House of Bellion]] but does not have good diplomacy with the [[Noble House of Paramoure]] or the [[Noble House of Maroon]]. They come to an agreement for the [[Summerset Princess]] to have her send her militia to the Capital City, as long as [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] can put someone in power to accept the militia as part of a defense against an invasion. She offers to allow them guided passage through the [[The Feywild|Fey Realm]] to the Capital, or offer them High Bred Forest Stags to get them to [[Thimbleville]]. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] decides to go to the Capital. 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] returns to an inn, drinking mead to relax after battle and exchanging stories to continue to build comradery between them. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] goes to bed, and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] is pulled into a dreamscape, and finds himself with a strange blue humanoid creature who says his name is [[Nebun]]. He considers himself some sort of leader of the [[Scribes of Fidchelle]], and demands [[Evan Escence|Evan]] to stop meddling in affairs and perform as they were meant to. Observe and write. Nothing more. [[Evan Escence|Evan]], however, feels a conflict of interest. 

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] awakens. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] mentions he had a strange dream. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] mentions he dreamed of "his angel". And [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] proceeds back to the Palace to utilize a fey portal and guide to get to The Capital quickly. She creates a portal within a nearby tree, and from within a beetle like creature will come out. She introduces it as [[Bumblebop]] who will guide them to the intended direction and destination. This portal feels different from their last time they travelled through. 

[[Bumblebop]] guides them through, scaring away any fey that might bother them and makign sure [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] keeps up with him. They come across a tree ent, that [[Bumblebop]] stops for, and [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] discovers its [[Kenobade]]. He greets [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] and then bids them good luck on their journey. They also come across another adventuring party along the way. They come upon a [[Hobo]], [[A Pouty Half Elf]], and a [[Lizardman who thinks he is a Dragonborn]] They exchange some words of encouragement and then move on. They come across the destination through the portal, and pass through. They did not arrive too far from the Capital but it will still take a bit of a walk. [[Bumblebop]] gives [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] a parting salute, and goes back to the Fey Realm, where the portal to becomes a gnarled tree once more.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] sighs in relief of finally returning to urban civil society.  [[Evan Escence|Evan]] takes [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to the Southern Gate, pointing out places that he's visited just outside the walls with excitement. Once passed the gates, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] wishes [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to come to his noble estate. [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] is perturbed by the urban shaped trees and cut weeds the nobles use for their low cut fields. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] leads [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to the gates of House Essence, and is greeted by his favourite butler [[Paul McCoy]]. [[Paul McCoy|Paul]] opens the gates for [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] and leads them to the Mansion. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] asks about the famaily; [[Paul McCoy|Paul]] says that [[Brother. Essence|his brother]] is away but everyone else is in house, including [[Evan Escence|Evan]]'s master [[Ed Sher'ran]]. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] must relieve themselves of their weapons at the entrance of the mansion. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] decides to meet with his father, first and foremost. They enter his office, and he immediately offers his son a deep bear hug embrace. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] introduces [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] to his father, and he introduces himself as [[George Diorissimo Escence|George Escence]]. After [[Evan Escence|Evan]] describes his adventure, he also shares the dire need to set someone in power and asks about [[Ledd]]. His father shares as much as he knows, and calls upon a family meeting to have a proper discussion. [[Jacqueline Escence|Evan's mother]] joins first, then [[Emelia Escence|his sister]] who is very upset that he did not see her first, and while [[Evan Escence|Evan]] tries to play up his return, [[Jacqueline Escence|his mother]] keeps things in scope, and respectfully recognize [[Evan Escence|Evan]] is taking things a little more seriously since his departure a year ago. The family discusses current events among the noble houses. George reminds [[Evan Escence|Evan]] is he becomes Emperor that his adventures end, and [[Evan Escence|Evan]] states maybe he could still use his presence to check things out and bring out potential dark ends. George then goes on about the noble houses:

- The [[Noble House of Escence]] has made a very substantial and successful business from alchemical practices related to person hygiene and cleaning rumored to have harsh labor practices
- The [[Noble House of Van Halen]] have made their name through their diplomacy and social skills, though rumor has it they made a deal with a devil to obtain such diplomatic status.
- The [[Noble House of Foo]] has made itself known as one of the best private security organizations with some of the best trained guardsmen gifted with Wuzhia lineage, but there is question of their loyalty since they are not entirely [[Arcaedian]] native.
- The [[Noble House of Paramoure]] has control over the religious temples and districts; funding, caring, and employing them with various members. Though, such deep religious ties makes them an easy target for cult activity
- The [[Noble House of Maroon]] were once famous explorers and are one of the oldest noble houses, tying back to the founding days of [[Arcaedia|The Arcaedian Dominion]] with their cartography and scribes for [[Arcaedian]] history. Though, they have the lowest relationships with other houses.
- The [[Noble House of Chevelle]] have a deep lineage of arcane practices and control the arcane schools of wizardry and libraries of arcane knowledge; though it is clear their lineage is taking a toll on them and people fear a curse has befell them.
- The [[Noble House of Bellion]] has a monopoly on fine wines and culinary feasts, which makes them a target for black market ingredients, potentially even Canabalization.
- The [[Noble House of Urie]] are information brokers, as well as one of the largest and richest houses in part of their well developed social status. They seek the throne most of all, especially [[Brand Diodah Urie]]
- The [[Noble House of Mumford]] are a house of bards and have some of the best performances and performers across the land, some event hink they are blessed by some sort of god-like being.

He mentions that the net meeting of the noble houses is in two days, where [[Evan Escence|Evan]] and party can see the chaos for themselves. With nothing more to discuss, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] decides to seek out [[Ed Sher'ran]], and George extends his house to [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] as their own. 

In the Grand Garden of [[Noble House of Escence|House Escence]], [[Ed Sher'ran]] is meditating in the garden. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] summons [[My Immortal]] and they join in on the meditation. They exchange some fitting words, Ed believing [[Evan Escence|Evan]] has grown stronger since he has last seen him. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] introduces his friends. [[Evan Escence|Evan]] believes his friends are better than he, but [[Ed Sher'ran]] disagrees, and wishes [[Evan Escence|Evan]] to show him.

[[Evan Escence|Evan]] proudly accepts the challenge. He and [[My Immortal]] pose up in battle preparation. [[Ed Sher'ran]] twists into a pose requiring incredible flexibility and summons [[EarthWindenFire]], his own battle spirit. And the two prepare for battle!
