 Following [[Session 12]]:

[[Lorellai]] has overcome her stomach ache and can now rejoin the party with [[Evan Escence]], [[Vimack Badger]], and [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble]]. While she was away, she had a fever dream about the city of [[Vasaros]] devestated into destruction, with a white raven surrounded by a cloud of ravens, and a cloud of bats coming from the north led by a stark white bat. 

The group decides to head back to the [[Pillars of Archons]] in an attempt to find and interrogate [[Xun Fen]]. Evan speaks to a local royal guard in order to get directions towards the royal advisor's office, and obtain directions. They find the office, and [[Xun Fen]] suggests he is busy and cannot be bothered, but Evan says he wants to discuss the debt owed by the [[Noble House of Urie]]. After welcomed in, Evan repeats his reason for the visit, but Xun Fen wants to see the documentation. Evan has to use Delusion in order to convince Xun Fen he actually has any paperwork in his possession. However, Xun Fen is not taking to the lie, and points out to the paperwork on his desk that he is extremely busy. Evan tries to cause a bit of chaos by pulling on the paperwork at his desk, but Xen Fen manages to catch his hand, with Evan noticing he is very quick and his grip is very strong. When things have calmed slightly, Ronpip shares with [[Xun Fen]] that the high elves are intending to invade. 
> [!succes]Critical Success
> Ronpip's information has persuaded [[Xen Fen]], and he believes his story

However, Ronpip noticed that [[Xun Fen]] is rather overly accepting of this information, as he does not seem particularly bothered that armies are headed towards [[Vasaros]]. They try to call on his suspicious calmness, though he argues a person who is now in charge needs to remain calm at all times for a level head. Ronpip mentions that they visited with [[Noble House of Foo]], and that [[Duan Ping]] mentioned [[Yin Lei]] spoke very highly of him. Though these comments do not seem to phase his integrity. Vimack keeps an eye on his micro expressions and sees that the information about the invasion seems to be working in his head on how he can benefit from it. Vimack then inquires how the emperor passed, which [[Xun Fen]] quickly answers that it was natural from old age. Evan implies that the high elves poisoned him, though Ronpip and [[Xun Fen]] refute that idea. Vimack then puts out the idea that someone close to him could have dispatched him quiet to be put into a place of power, and he noticed [[Xun Fen]] is suddenly very on guard. Vimack then implies a level of blackmail.
> [!success] Critical Success
> [[Xun Fen]] is starting to fear for his life and position; and its beginning to surface with some sweat upon his brow and his heart rate and pressure increasing.

Ronpip points out that when Vimack gets this way, it only goes well if the victim is honest. [[Xun Fen]] seems willing to hear his options if he is unable to escape the situation. Vimack implies that they should calmly open the room to discussion, and [[Lorellai]] mentions rumors of treachery about [[Xun Fen]] 

[[Xun Fen]] immediately calms, seeming to be fully convinced now that the party knows nothing. He is able to refute all further accusations towards him, and is done having the party waste his time and asks the party to leave before he has to call the guard. Vimack tries to bring the conversation back to poisoning the emperor, but [[Xen Fen]] is unbothered, and warns again that the party should leave before he calls the guard. Evan opens up that [[Qui Chun]] has a warehouse he frequents that had poisons hidden away in a secret basement but he refutes that the party has any proof and its a convenient rumor. He is beginning to become aggravated by the party but does not want to instill violence in his office, so continues to warn he will call upon the guards if the party continues to harass him. Vimack has some final words, and then the party exits the office. Evan spends some of his psionic energy to knock some of the papers over in a final petty action. 

The party retreats nearby and hatch a secondary plan. Ronpip sticks behind to watch the office door, and the party wanders. Half an hour later, they return and Ronpip points out he's been picking up papers for the passed half hour. Vimack takes the watch and the next half hour passes with nothing happens. [[Lorellai]] makes herself invisible and gets closer to the door while the rest of the party wanders for the next half hour. A servant comes down the hall with a tray, and [[Lorellai]] moves out of his way to then sneak into the room behind the servant. [[Xun Fen]] is continuing to write paperwork, waves the servant off who delivers the tray, and the servant leaves. [[Lorellai]] finds herself in a moment of anxiety as she is now alone and must make a decision for herself. [[Xun Fen]] pours himself tea completely unaware of [[Lorellai]]'s presence. [[Lorellai]] slowly investigates his office, trying to find something she could take with her. There is a lock box on his shelf, open, that contains letters and scrolls not of Arcaedian origin. She reaches in and carefully tucks some of the scrolls into her armor. [[Lorellai]] is once again in a moment of anxiety as to if she should look further or exit, or how to exit the office. She sneaks to the door, and exits, seemingly with no problem. She then runs to go find them, though ends up running along their original patrol route. Vimack, Evan, and Ronpip return to their stake out position, and [[Lorellai]] is not to be found. Ronpip attempts to [[Detect Magic]] and does not detect any traces of an invisible being. Evan channels psionic energy into his eyes to see invisible creatures, but sees no one. He tries to channel his now Perfect Senses to try and track her but cannot find any method to track her. Ronpip and Evan head down their patrol route, and Vimack lingers behind. A now visible [[Lorellai]] appears before Vimack, and says they should leave to talk about what she find.

Eventually the party manages to finally meet up with each other. They decide now is a good time to head back to [[Duan Ping]] and relay their findings. However, upon arriving, they notice the streets are oddly empty, and upon approaching the gates of Foo's main estate, [[Gau Meng]] steps out from a corner and blocks their way. He tells them they know that they are investigating their house, to return to their own manor, and to not attempt to enter the estate or speak to any [[Noble House of Foo|Foo]] members hence forth. Multiple monks hop over the walls, hidden from sight, and brandish their weapons in a show or power and intimidation, showing the party is heavily out numbered and possible out matched. The party is not nervous about being ambushed and surrounded, and they agree they could go home but look to Evan for where to go. Evan, openly, states the party should return to his house, and the party exits through the open way the ambushers have left open for them. 

A ways away, they discuss what they know and the possibilities of [[Duan Ping]] being in danger, considering the show of force. Evan wants to sneak into the estate in order to get a quick talk to [[Duan Ping]], but Ronpip suggests actually getting the scrolls that [[Lorellai]] managed to steal translated, either to see their usefulness or to know for himself what is in the scrolls. The party returns to Escence Manor, concerned they are being spied upon and their next move will be predicted again. Evan tries to see if his immediate family can speak Draconic, but no one available can translate the language. Evan takes the party back to [[Rasul|the dragonborn that sold him the Spell Scrolls]]. The party attempts to hide the source of the scrolls from him, and Evan manages to persuade him but he feels odd about them because they are Wuzhia in origin and not magic scrolls. [[Lorellai]] asks if he may know someone who could help them. [[Rasul]] says he knows a guy on the western shanty town the locals call [[Shanty Town Citicounty]], but he's a grumpy fellow and is unsure how helpful he would actually be, but [[Lorellai]] is confident they can handle grumpy. [[Lorellai]] inquires if there is something they could tribute to him to lighten his mood, and [[Rasul]] suggests the largest fish they can catch.

Vimack dives into the nearest harbor and rage fishes to catch the largest fish in the lake, and manages to rage grapple a supremely large fish from the deep of the lake worth 160 lbs. Its eight at night when the party arrives to [[Shanty Town Citicounty]], eyeing Vimack and the giant fish. They knock on the door of the suggested helper, trying to deliver the fish. Inside, [[Brassy|a heavily aged Brass Dragonborn showing heavy oxidation across his metallic scales]] demands what they want. The party lets him know they need some scrolls translated, and are willing to trade the 160 lb fish for his service. With due haste, he lets them in and demands them to drop off the fish. While [[Brassy|the brass dragonborn]] is hoping to chow down as soon as possible, Vimack barters that the scrolls to be translated first. [[Brassy|The brass dragonborn]] begins to read and translates, though the dialect is strange to him. After his initial translation, he seems to forget why the fish was given to him. Vimack sees an opportunity to get him to translate multiple times considering the dialect is strange to him.

Roughly, he gets:
- "The country to the east wanting to know about the emperor"
- "Stone queen interested in knowing who the new emperor is"
-  "Weakening the empire"
-  "Weakening the emperor"
-  "Weakening the continent" (of Arcaedia)
-  "Crystal Empress wanting to know who the king is"
-  "Dethroning the tree... the pillar? Uprooting the pillar?? Desaturating... the hero"

Vimack thanks him for his service, and leaves a note for him including his name and "From House Escence" on it, with the party including their names and "Contact for help." They finally ask him his name, and he says his name is [[Brassy]]. The party leaves and lets [[Brassy]] enjoy his fish.

The party regathers, and decide that the cover of dark is a good time to try and infiltrate the Foo estate, and reach [[Duan Ping]] in secret to relay him the information he requested. They decide to have Evan be eyes in the sky while Ronpip is turned invisible to enter the estate. 

The sneak into the night of the area associated with the [[Noble House of Foo]]. When they are within sight but still far, they begin to cook their plan into motion. They notice a some patrols outside the walls of the estate.
