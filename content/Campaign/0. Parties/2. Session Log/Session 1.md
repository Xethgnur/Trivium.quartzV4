[[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] also wishes to send a letter, to [[Thimbleville]].

The next morning, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] begins its 4 day journey towards the earlier scouted area that [[Yohan Sheppard|Yohan]] would like to start a town in. Although, during the travel, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] is suffering from [[Style]]. Everyone is gravely concerned.

[[Yohan Sheppard|Yohan]] wants to start choosing the resource to focus on first. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] volunteers to scout the forest for good trees to cut down for wood, while [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] suggests sending the militia to start hunting to acquire food and skins.

### [[The Party Goes Missing]]
After a short rest from the encounter, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] comes across a once sealed cave. They discover a [[Mysterious Cave]]. Inside they discover a unique symbol that almost looks like a spider on a time dial, a [[Time Spider]]. They also discover the skeletal remains of [[Drow]] elves, which seem like they have been trapped here for quite some time. Deeper still, they discover a [[Mirror Wall Made of Time Crystal]].

Seeing their reflections, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] tries to interact with his, triggering the mirror. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] is drowned in a liquid of space-time, and they are melded with a multiverse branch of themselves.

### The Party returns to Camp
[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] reawakens, finds that they have strange memories and knowledge. They are greeted by a militia from the caravan, who is as confused as they are but for different reasons. He tells [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] they've been missing for three days. The militiaman tries to hurry them back to the caravan, as they have come to an emergency that requires more personal help from [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]].

Upon reaching the camp, and find a medical tent has been risen at the center of camp. Inside are soldiers suffering from acid burns, bites, and scratches. They say a large black reptile attacked them while they were hunting. [[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] gathers information of the whereabouts of the attacker, and then proceed to rest before seeking out the attacker.

Upon waking, [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] seeks medical attention for his ear. [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] needs to get questions of his chest, and [[Dr. Hammond]] recommends speaking to a man named [[Old Man Haggard]] in town. They find him in a fairly obvious spot at the center of camp. The confront him with mirror magic questions, their absence, and any assistance they may obtain. He provides them a [[Rod of Elements]] in order to assist them, but demands it back once they finish. 

Before they head out to the forest, [[Evan Escence|Evan]] checks to see if a courier has come for him but, unfortunately, one has not come. With nothing left, they head out into the forest.

>[!success]
