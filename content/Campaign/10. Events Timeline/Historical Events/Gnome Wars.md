%% Event Text Here %%

A covert war between the Rock Gnomes in the Savage Hillscape and the Goblins and Kobolds in the same area broke out. Denied help by the Arcaedian Dominion, and rejected by their Fey Heritage, they were left to defend on their own. Both sides were cunning, with their own forms of ingenuity. For nearly two and a half decades, neither side could overrun the other. 
Until the incident of 425-04-05, where a experimental gnome test weapon went off, and disintegrated a large area around a former settlement. The conclusion of the gnomes was to cover it up and apply contingency protections to prevent anything from entering the DMZ(disintegrated military zone), and anything that survived in.
