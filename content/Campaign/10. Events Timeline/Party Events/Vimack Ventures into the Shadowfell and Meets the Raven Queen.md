%% Event Text Here %%

[[Vimack Badger]] steps through the portal into the [[Shadowfell]], where all he can do is wait for his companions to rescue him. He is greeted by the Raven Queen, who tasks him with killing "The White Bat" but keeps all details coy and overly broad. When [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]] agrees, she pushes him back to [[The Material Plane]] where he is pulled by a Paladin Judge.

While it has been only 20 minutes for [[Vimack Badger|Vimack]], his companions have had him missing for several hours...
