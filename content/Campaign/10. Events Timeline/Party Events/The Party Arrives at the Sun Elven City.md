%% Event Text Here %%

The Party is guided by Bonley Shroomcap to the correct path within the Summer's Forest, keeping them safe and out of trickery from local fey-life. In no time, they reach their destination as requested by the Gold Dragon, and they hope to appeal with the Summerset Princess to join a Defensive Pact against the Northern Elven Armies.
