%% Event Text Here %%

The Party has met with the [[Summerset Princess]] and requested help against the Northern Elven invasion. However, she cannot do anything due to a pact treaty with them made ages ago. If [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] visited the island and, with witness, saw that the tree on the island was dying, that meant the treaty was broken, and she may help them.
