[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] requires an extended amount of time to think about the things that had recently happened. The moral issues keep them from each other, from the leadership, and within their minds. Still, to pass the time and process hardships, they work to help the town build itself from a messy caravan and camp into working and hardworking village to start.
