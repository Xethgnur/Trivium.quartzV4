%% Event Text Here %%

[[Trivium Party Hub|The party]] interrogates the Royal Advisor under suspicion of poisoning the former Emperor, and discover some scrolls but they are in Wuzhiyan, which none of them speak. They go and see about getting it translated by a dragonborn in the dockslums, who helps them for a big fish.
The dragonborn translates it into roughly "The Jade Empress seeks to weaken her adversaries."
