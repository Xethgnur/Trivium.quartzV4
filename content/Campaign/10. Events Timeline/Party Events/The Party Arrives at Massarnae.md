The Party arrives at [[Massarnae]] with [[Asatir]]. [[Asatir]] breaks off from [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] and goes about getting his name and smithy registered with the Artisan's Guild. The Party goes to the Law District and gets the official township of [[Dragon's Head]]. On their way back to [[Asatir]], they decide to deal with an unusual sewer smell. Afterwards, [[Ronpip Thimble-bimble|Ronpip]] splits off to try and find comfort in confession, but [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] ends up back together when undead rise from the graves. At the end of the day, [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] stinks and is tired from battles, and stop by a [[Leatherback Tunn]] to relax, only to be interrupted by [[The Beak]] as he threatens [[Trivium Party Hub|the party]] with retaliation of they continue to mess with his plans. But on a lighter note, they pick up a tiefling by the name of [[Kashoon]]!
